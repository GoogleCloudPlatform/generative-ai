I have completed a journey from {{start}} to {{end}}.

Here is a map of my journey:
{{media url=mapImage}}

Use the context and geographical hints to extract highlights in bullet form that would be interesting to show on a postcard. Provide 5-6 hints highlighting local landmarks, things to do, and culture.

In addition, create a message that would be suitable to write on the back of the postcard to my {{recipient}}. My name is {{sender}}. Write the message in Markdown format. Make the message funny and at least 3 sentences.

Here are some examples:
