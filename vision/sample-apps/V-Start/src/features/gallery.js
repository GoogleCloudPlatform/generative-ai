In one hand, they hold a gnarled wooden staff entwined with glowing energy conduits and topped with a floating, crystalline artifact. Perched on their shoulder is a small, mechanical owl with holographic wings and camera-lens eyes that blink with a soft, red light. Their expression is serene and ancient, eyes holding a deep, knowing look.",
