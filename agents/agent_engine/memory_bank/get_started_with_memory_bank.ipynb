We will apply these concepts to a practical, real-world retail scenario: building a sophisticated assistant for an online fashion store.\n",

        "* **Memory Customization**: We will dive into domain-specific adaptation by defining custom memory topics and providing few-shot examples to improve the accuracy of data extraction.\n",
        "* **Lifecycle Management**: Finally, we will address essential operational aspects like configuring Time-To-Live (TTL) for data retention and compliance, and managing the overall lifecycle of memories."
