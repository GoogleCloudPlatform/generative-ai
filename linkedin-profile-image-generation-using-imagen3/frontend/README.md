QuickBot App is a set of templates that can be deployed out of the box into Cloud Run and work independently. Each one can be run independently connected to the user default google cloud auth credentials, and based on the complexity of each template, may require to deploy more or less resources into our Google Cloud Project. 
The architecture always follows the following structure: a folder for the frontend which consists in an Angular app, and a backend folder which consists of a FastAPI Python app.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
