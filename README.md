Quickbot is an innovative, out-of-the-box solution enabling users to deploy sophisticated AI Agents as full-stack cloud applications on their own Google Cloud Platform (GCP) accounts, entirely without requiring any coding expertise. It empowers you to seamlessly integrate and customize Google's latest AI models and protocols through intuitive templates.

## Our Mission
To democratize Agentic AI application deployment. We provide a seamless, one-click style solution that installs fully functional and visually engaging Agentic AI applications (encompassing both backend and frontend infrastructure, leveraging diverse templates) into your own GCP account. This process is designed to be completed quickly.

Quickbot addresses the challenge users face in independently building and deploying custom AI Agents as full-stack cloud applications within their own GCP environments simply and directly. We believe users want to **own the code** in their GCP accounts and **customize it as needed**.

## Features

* **Preset Templates:** Quickly create custom agents with ready-to-use options.
* **Fast Deployment:** Get sophisticated AI applications running in your GCP account in under 10 minutes.
* **Customizable Codebase:** Full access to the open-source code (Angular frontend, Python FastAPI backend) for direct interaction and modification.
* **Cloud Run Deployment:** Each template can be deployed as an independent application on Google Cloud Run.
* **Standardized Architecture:** Every agent template includes an Angular frontend and a FastAPI Python backend, ensuring a consistent development experience.
* **Google Cloud Authentication:** Uses your default Google Cloud credentials for seamless integration.
* **Scalable Resources:** Deploys necessary Google Cloud resources based on each template's complexity.
* **Latest AI Integration:** Easily leverage Google's cutting-edge AI models and protocols (e.g., Gemini, Imagen, Vertex AI Search (ex Agent Builder)).
* **Diverse Template Ecosystem:** Utilizes a variety of Agentic Templates, including our own and inspirations from others like Agent Garden, A2A, etc.

## Architecture

Quickbot templates follow a standard and straightforward architecture:

* `frontend/`: Contains the Angular application that provides the user interface.
* `backend/`: Contains the FastAPI (Python) application that powers the agent's logic and interacts with Google Cloud services.

This separation allows for clear development workflows and independent scaling of frontend and backend services.

## Available Templates

Quickbot provides a growing set of pre-built templates:

* **[ADK Travel Concierge MultiAgent Template](./multi-agent-travel-concierge-with-adk/):** Leveraging the [ADK](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/) + [Agent Engine](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/overview) capabilities, and taking advantage from the usage of [Agent Garden](https://console.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/agents/agent-garden), this [Travel MultiAgent](https://github.com/google/adk-samples/tree/main/python/agents/travel-concierge) orchestrates personalized travel experiences and provides support throughout the userâ€™s journey, from initial planning to real-time itinerary alerts.

## Getting Started

Follow these general steps to get a Quickbot template running in your local environment.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Google Cloud Project:** You'll need a GCP project with billing enabled.
2.  **Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud`):** [Install and initialize the gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
3.  **Node.js and npm:** We recommend using [nvm (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to manage Node.js versions.
    * Install nvm, then install a compatible Node.js version (e.g., v18.x or later).
    * Install Angular CLI: `npm install -g @angular/cli@18` (or the version specified by the template).
4.  **Python:** Python 3.8+ and `pip` are required.
    * `sudo apt install python3 python3-pip` (Linux example)
5.  **Git:** For cloning the repository.
6.  **(Optional) Docker and docker-compose:** Useful for containerized development and deployment.

### Option 1: Using Docker Compose (Recommended for Quick Start)

This is the **simplest way to get the entire application (frontend and backend) up and running!** You just need to run `docker compose up` after initial setup. See the next steps:

1.  **Ensure Docker and Docker Compose v2 are installed and running.**

2.  **Authenticate with Google Cloud:**
    Your template (agents with Agent Engine, Imagen 4, VertexAI Search, etc) will need to interact with Google Cloud services, so you need to provide Google Cloud credentials. For local development with ADC:
    ```bash
    gcloud auth application-default login
    gcloud config set project <your-gcp-project-id> # If using a specific GCP project
    gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project <your-gcp-project-id> # If using a specific GCP project

    # Verify your configuration
    gcloud auth list
    gcloud config list project
    ```
    The `docker-compose.yml` file is configured to mount these local credentials into the backend container.
    > **IMPORTANT!!** Update the `_PROJECT_ID` and `GCLOUD_PROJECT` in `docker-compose.yml` so it points to your project!

    > **Windows Users:** The path to ADC might differ. Adjust volume mounts in `docker-compose.yml` if needed.

    > **Note:** Ensure any required APIs are enabled in your Google Cloud project if used.    

3.  **Run the application:**
    Build the Docker images for the frontend and backend services, and start the services, all with one simple command:
    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```
    The backend will be configured using environment variables (see "Environment Variables" section), including any necessary API keys for travel services, ADK configurations, or Agent Engine settings.

    The frontend should typically be available at `http://localhost:4200` (or as configured) and the backend API at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Option 2: Manual Setup (for Development and Customization)

Follow these steps if you prefer to run the frontend and backend services manually on your local machine.

**A. Backend Setup**

1.  **Navigate to the `backend/` directory.**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    # Check if you are already in an environment
    pip -V

    # If not, create and activate (for Linux/macOS)
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate

    # Install requirements
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    > **VS Code Tip:** If VS Code doesn't recognize your virtual environment, press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (or `Cmd + Shift + P` on Mac), type "Python: Select Interpreter", choose "Enter interpreter path...", and then find and select `.venv/bin/python` inside your `backend` directory.

3.  **Setup Google Cloud (`gcloud`) credentials (if applicable):**
    If your backend, agents, or Agent Engine interact with GCP, ensure you're authenticated.
    ```bash
    gcloud auth login # Login with your user account
    gcloud config set project <your-gcp-project-id> # If using a specific GCP project

    # For services using Application Default Credentials (ADC) locally
    gcloud auth application-default login
    gcloud auth application-default set-quota-project <your-gcp-project-id> # If using a specific GCP project

    # Verify configuration
    gcloud auth list
    gcloud config list project
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Backend configuration is managed via environment variables. Create a `.local.env` file in the `backend/` directory (copy from `.local.env.example` if one exists). This file should be in `.gitignore`.

    *   **For Mac/Windows (or zsh console on Linux):**
        Source the variables directly (from the `backend/` directory):
        ```bash
        . ./.local.env
        ```
    *   **For Linux (bash):**
        Open `backend/.venv/bin/activate` and append the `export` commands from your `backend/.local.env` file after the `PATH` export section. For example:
        ```sh
        # ... existing activate script content ...
        _OLD_VIRTUAL_PATH="$PATH"
        PATH="$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin:$PATH"
        export PATH

        # Quickbot env variables (copied from .local.env)
        export ENVIRONMENT="development"
        export FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:4200"
        # ADK, Agent Engine, and Travel API variables
        # export ADK_CONFIG_PATH="/path/to/adk_config.json"
        # export AGENT_ENGINE_ENDPOINT="http://localhost:xxxx/api/agent-engine" # Or other config
        # export FLIGHT_API_KEY="your_flight_api_key"
        # export HOTEL_API_KEY="your_hotel_api_key"
        # export WEATHER_API_KEY="your_weather_api_key"
        # ... other necessary agent or backend variables ...
        ```
    Verify the variables are set by running `env` in your activated terminal.

5.  **Run the setup script (if applicable):**
    This script might perform initial configurations for the ADK, Agent Engine, or agent registration.
    ```bash
    # from the backend/ directory
    python3 setup.py
    ```

6.  **Run the backend application:**
    ```bash
    # from the backend/ directory
    uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8080
    ```

**B. Frontend Setup**

(These instructions assume a typical TypeScript/Angular frontend. Adjust as necessary based on your `frontend/README.md`.)

1.  **Navigate to the `frontend/` directory.**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Environment Variables (if applicable):**
    The frontend might require its own environment configuration (e.g., via a `.env` file or Angular's `environment.ts` files for API endpoints). Check the `frontend/` directory or its `README.md` for specific instructions.
4.  **Run the frontend application:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # Or, for many Angular projects:
    # ng serve
    ```
    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:4200`.
## Authentication

Quickbot templates can be integrated with **Firebase Authentication** for user sign-up, sign-in, and management. Configuration details for Firebase are typically found in the frontend's `src/environments/environment.ts` file. You can use existing Firebase projects or set up new ones to connect with your deployed agents.

## Code Styling & Commit Guidelines

To maintain code quality and consistency:

* **TypeScript (Frontend):** We follow [Angular Coding Style Guide](https://angular.dev/style-guide) by leveraging the use of [Google's TypeScript Style Guide](https://github.com/google/gts) using `gts`. This includes a formatter, linter, and automatic code fixer.
* **Python (Backend):** We adhere to the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html), using tools like `pylint` and `black` for linting and formatting.
* **Commit Messages:** We suggest following [Angular's Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md) to create clear and descriptive commit messages.

#### Frontend (TypeScript with `gts`)

1.  **Initialize `gts` (if not already done in the project):**
    Navigate to the `frontend/` directory and run:
    ```bash
    npx gts init
    ```
    This will set up `gts` and create necessary configuration files (like `tsconfig.json`). Ensure your `tsconfig.json` (or a related gts config file like `.gtsrc`) includes an extension for `gts` defaults, typically:
    ```json
    {
      "extends": "./node_modules/gts/tsconfig-google.json",
      // ... other configurations
    }
    ```
2.  **Check for linting issues:**
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```
    (This assumes a `lint` script is defined in `package.json`, e.g., `"lint": "gts lint"`)
3.  **Fix linting issues automatically (where possible):**
    ```bash
    npm run fix
    ```
    (This assumes a `fix` script is defined in `package.json`, e.g., `"fix": "gts fix"`)

#### Backend (Python with `pylint` and `black`)

1.  **Ensure Dependencies are Installed:**
    Add `pylint` and `black` to your `backend/requirements.txt` file:
    ```
    pylint
    black
    ```
    Then install them within your virtual environment:
    ```bash
    pip install pylint black
    # or pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Configure `pylint`:**
    It's recommended to have a `.pylintrc` file in your `backend/` directory to configure `pylint` rules. You might need to copy a standard one or generate one (`pylint --generate-rcfile > .pylintrc`).
3.  **Check for linting issues with `pylint`:**
    Navigate to the `backend/` directory and run:
    ```bash
    pylint .
    ```
    (Or specify modules/packages: `pylint your_module_name`)
4.  **Format code with `black`:**
    To automatically format all Python files in the current directory and subdirectories:
    ```bash
    python -m black . --line-length=80
    ```
