        "- To troubleshoot which part failed: Ask the model to describe the image, or ask the model to explain its reasoning, to gauge the model's initial understanding.\n",
        "- If your prompt results in hallucinated content: Try dialing down the temperature setting or asking the model for shorter descriptions so that it's less likely to extrapolate additional details.\n",
