    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows how you can build a question-answering (Q&A) system (or \"bot\") over multiple large documents so that Vertex AI PaLM API can answer any questions about the contents of those documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many companies have lots of information stored in documents, but retrieving that information easily and quickly can be challenging. To solve this, you will build a question-answering system powered by PaLM API to enable users to extract or query important details from those documents, which could be in any standard doc format such as .pdf, .doc, .docx, .txt, .pptx, or .html.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge with building a Q&A system over large documents is that you must do more than just pass the entire documents, into the prompts themselves, as the prompt context. This is because LLMs, including [Vertex PaLM API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/learn/models), have token limits that [restrict how much context you can provide](https://ai.google/static/documents/palm2techreport.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "So how can you build a Q&A system with restrictions on token lengths? To solve this, in addition to your question (your prompt), you will need to provide just the relevant context; context that comes from your closed-domain sources (i.e. the large documents).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will see three methods that can address the large context challenge, known as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stuffing** - pushing whole document content as a context.\n",
    "* **Map-Reduce** - splitting documents in smaller chunks.\n",
    "* **Map-Reduce - embedding** - creating embeddings of smaller chunks and using vector similarity search to find relevant context.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook introduces you to the fundamental approach towards handling huge documents for building a question-answering bot using Vertex PaLM API and finding relevant context for a user query, keeping the context limitation in check.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, there can be open source or Google Cloud drop-in replacement of steps, which will be discussed later in the notebook."

    "## Question Answering with large documents\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most commonly used methods across the industry is `chains` to solve question-answering with large and multiple documents using LLMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "A chain is a sequence of steps an LLM takes to complete a task. For example, a chain might start with the LLM reading a document, then asking a question about the document, and finally generating a response to the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "An index chain is a special type of chain that uses an index to store and retrieve information. An index is a data structure that allows the LLM to quickly find relevant information for a given task. For example, an index chain might use an index to store the names of all the people mentioned in a document so that the LLM can quickly find the information it needs to answer a question about those people. Or it can store document path, name, page number, and other metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to create a simple index of all source documents so that LLMs can search through vast information easily. Index chains are helpful in question-answering, summarization, and chatbot\n",
    "\n",
    "Foundationally, there are four [index-related chains](https://docs.langchain.com/docs/components/chains/index_related_chains):\n",
    "* Stuffing\n",
    "* Map Reduce\n",
    "* Refine\n",
    "* Map-Rerank\n",

    "### Method 1: Stuffing\n",
    "\n",
    "Stuffing is the simplest way to pass data to a large language model (LLM). You simply combine all of the data into a single prompt, and then pass that prompt to the LLM. This method has two advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It only makes a single call to the LLM, which can improve performance.\n",
    "* The LLM has access to all of the data at once, which can improve the quality of the generated text.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, stuffing has one major disadvantage: it only works with small amounts of data. If you have a large dataset, stuffing will not be feasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you dive deeper into possible methods for large document question-answering, you can explore the primary process of stuffing and how it fails with larger files and context.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the flow of stuffing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Document Loader**: Loading the required document from the source to your bucket or local storage.\n",
    "* **Document Processing**: Processing the documents by extracting content and other metadata.\n",
    "* **Context**: Building the context to pass the entire content extracted in the previous step.\n",
    "* **Prompt Engineering**: Building a question-answering prompt that takes the context built in the previous step and adds instructions to perform specific tasks.\n",
    "* **Vertex PaLM API**: Finally, with the prompt and the context, call the PaLM API to get the expected answer."
