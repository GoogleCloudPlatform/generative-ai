    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build a question-answering (Q&A) system using LangChain with Vertex AI PaLM API to extract information from large documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge with building a Q&A system over large documents is that Large Language Models, LLMs in short, have token limits that restrict how much context you can provide.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several methods to provide the context. They can use similarity search or not. Also there are different methods to pass context to LLMs. This notebook covers the following methods or chains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Stuffing**: Push the whole document content as a context. This is the simplest method, but it can be inefficient for large documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Map-Reduce**: Split documents into smaller chunks and process them in parallel. This is more efficient than stuffing, but it can be more complex to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Refine**: Run an initial prompt on a small chunk, generate an output and for each subsequent document, refine the output based on both output and new document. This is more efficient than Map-Reduce but less efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook also shows **Map-Reduce with Similarity search** where you create embeddings of smaller chunks and use vector similarity search to find relevant context. This is the most efficient method, but it can be the most complex to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",

Retrieval augmented generation is a technique for using a large language model (LLM) to answer questions about documents it was not trained on.

    "This notebook demonstrates how to build a question-answering (QA) system using LangChain with Vertex AI PaLM API to extract information from large documents.\n",

    "In this case, you use Chroma, an in-memory open-source embedding database to create similarity search index. But [Langchain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain/blob/master/docs/modules/indexes/vectorstores/examples/matchingengine.ipynb) supports Vertex AI Matching Engine, the Google Cloud high-scale low latency vector database. With Vertex AI Matching Engine, you have a fully managed service that can scale to meet the needs of even the most demanding applications. It provides high performance for both training and inference. And it has several features including support for multiple similarity metrics, batch inference, and online learning. These features can be important for applications that need to perform complex matching tasks or that need to be able to adapt to changing data."
