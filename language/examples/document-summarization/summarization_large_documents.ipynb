        "\n",
        "Summarizing a long document can be challenging. It requires you to identify the main points of the document, synthesize the information, and present it in a concise and coherent way. This can be especially difficult if the document is complex or technical. Additionally, summarizing a long document can be time-consuming, as you need to carefully read and analyze the text to ensure that the summary is accurate and complete.\n",
        "\n",
        "While these methods allow you to interact with LLMs and summarize long documents in a flexible way, you may sometimes want to speed up the process by using bootstrapping or pre-built methods. This is where libraries like LangChain come in. You can read more about LangChain support on Vertex AI [here](https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/models/llms/integrations/google_vertex_ai_palm.html)."
