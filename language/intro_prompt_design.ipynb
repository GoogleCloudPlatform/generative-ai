In the case of the sky, the particles that are responsible for Rayleigh scattering are molecules of nitrogen and oxygen. These molecules are so small that they are much smaller than the wavelength of visible light. When sunlight hits these molecules, it is scattered in all directions. However, the blue light is scattered more than the other colors of light. This is because the blue light has a shorter wavelength than the other colors of light. The shorter wavelength means that the blue light is more likely to be scattered by the molecules of nitrogen and oxygen. This is why the sky appears blue.\n"
