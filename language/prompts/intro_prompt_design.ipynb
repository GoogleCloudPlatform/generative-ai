        "Although LLMs have been trained on a large amount of data, they can generate text containing statements not grounded in truth or reality; these responses from the LLM are often referred to as \"hallucinations\" due to their limited memorization capabilities. Note that simply prompting the LLM to provide a citation isn't a fix to this problem, as there are instances of LLMs providing false or inaccurate citations. Dealing with hallucinations is a fundamental challenge of LLMs and an ongoing research area, so it is important to be cognizant that LLMs may seem to give you confident, correct-sounding statements that are in fact incorrect. \n",
