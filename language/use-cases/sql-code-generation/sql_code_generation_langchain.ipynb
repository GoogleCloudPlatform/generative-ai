        "## Overview\n",
        "Large language models can be used for generating code, including SQL. In particular, models can convert natural language text into SQL queries. One common purpose is to enable users to query data without requiring knowledge of tables' names, data schema nor the specific SQL dialect or query engine of the underlying data warehouse like BigQuery.\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook covers prompt engineering best practices for SQL code generation with [LangChain Google Cloud Vertex AI](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/llms/google_vertex_ai_palm) implementation, and puts in practice learnings from [SQL-PaLM: Improve Large Language Model Adaptation for text-to-SQL](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.00739.pdf). For example, the BigQuery dataset schema is retrieved and provided dynamically as context to the prompt, for grounding the LLM and personalizing its output. The notebook also demonstrates Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) by using [SemanticSimilarityExampleSelector](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/prompts/example_selector_types/similarity) from LangChain Example Selector to dynamically retrieve and pass the most relevant few shot examples to enrich the LLM prompt. This helps ensure most accurate and relevant LLM output, that is the generated SQL query, while limiting number of required LLM input tokens and thereby cost. The notebook also demonstrates simple model evaluation whereby the generated SQL queries are evaluated by executing them against the BigQuery dataset, and by comparing them with ground truth queries and corresponding results.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this notebook, you generate SQL queries to analyze Cloud Audit Logs and answer critical security questions around activity in your own Google Cloud project. While this notebook uses BigQuery logs dataset, the concepts and approach presented here can be applied to other databases and datasets.\n",
