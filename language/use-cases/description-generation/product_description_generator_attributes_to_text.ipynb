    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html) together with Vertex AI LLMs to solve a problem that many large retailers face: the automatic generation of informative, SEO-optimized, and potentially creative product descriptions and titles, based on product attributes or specifications (often provided by a supplier). The process of automated description generation can achieve significant cost and time savings.\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial shows how to start with raw product attributes and metadata to generate full, accurate, SEO-optimized, and safe descriptions using LLMs. You will also learn how to validate the descriptions using LLMs. Additionally, you how to use retrieval-augmented generation to make your prompts even better through k-NN (k-nearest neighbor) embedding search. Finally, it shows how to adapt the descriptions to your brand's writing style, even if the style differs per product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes on running this tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "The free public dataset sample used for this demo (authorized for personal or business use) can be downloaded [here](https://data.world/promptcloud/product-details-on-flipkart-com).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will learn how to use LangChain with the PaLM API to generate your product descriptions from existing product attributes. You will work through the following examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Zero-shot prompting of foundational models to generate descriptions\n",
    "* Zero-shot prompting of parameter-efficient tuned foundational models on custom corpora\n",
    "* Few-shot untuned (and tuned) prompting using Vertex AI Embeddings to retrieve similar examples to incorporate into the prompt. This is done locally in-memory for the tutorial but can be extended to use [Vertex AI Matching Engine](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/matching-engine/overview) (a managed, scalable vector database)\n",
    "* Using prompt-engineered LLM zero-shot prompts to check the safety, veracity, and quality of generated product descriptions, and generate a reasoning for its evaluation\n",
    "* Evaluating the batch quality of generated prompts using n-gram overlap metrics like BLEU and ROUGE, as well as semantic similarity checks (using embeddings with the PaLM API) with both possible and negative examples\n",
    "* Using basic and advanced LangChain constructs such as prompt templates, LLM chains, sequential LLM chains (for sequential prompts with multiple inputs and outputs, with the output of one fed as input to another), k-NN retrievers, and custom LLM classes to use Vertex AI and LangChain.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will also see that using few-shot prompting computed using k-NN Vertex AI LLM embedding based  semantic similarity can boost the performance metrics across BLEU/ROUGE and semantic similarity. Additionally, you can add additional product properties by utilizing a Vertex Generative AI image captioning service, which can then also add to the richness of the product description.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Costs\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial uses billable components of Google Cloud:\n",
    "- Vertex AI Generative AI Studio\n",
    "\n",
    "Learn about [Vertex AI pricing](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/pricing), and use the [Pricing Calculator](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator/) to generate a cost estimate based on your projected usage."

    "In this notebook, you learned how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Leverage few-shot examples to ground the LLM and avoid hallucination, as well as tailor the generated descriptions closer to existing ones for similar products.\n",
    "* Use the Vertex AI textembeddings model to assess semantic similarity\n",
    "* Create LangChain Prompts, Retrievers, Chains, and Sequential Chains to generate more creative and engaging product descriptions.\n",
    "* Batch evaluate the quality of generated text against original text using BLEU, ROUGE, and semantic similarity (based on cosine distance) scores.\n",
    "* Guardrail the agent using a validator LLM model to ensure that the generated text is accurate, truthful, and creative.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Possible next steps you can take:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can add additional product properties by utilizing the,[Vertex AI Image Captioning service](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/image/image-captioning) which can then also add to the richness of the product description.\n",
    "* You can try using RLHF (reinforcement learning with human feedback) to perform preference optimization between multiple generated descriptions."
