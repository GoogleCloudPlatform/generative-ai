        "# Why does hybrid search matter?\n",
        "\n",
        "As described in [Overview of Vector Search](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search/overview), semantic search with Vector Search can find items with semantic similarity by using queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "Embedding models such as Vertex AI embeddings build a vector space as a map of content meanings. Each text or multimodal embedding is a location in the map that represents the meaning of some content. As a simplified example, when an embedding model takes a text that discusses movies for 10%, music for 2%, and actors for 30%, it could represent this text with an embedding `[0.1, 0.02, 0.3]`. With Vector Search, you can quickly find other embeddings in its neighborhood. This searching by content meaning is called semantic search.\n",
        "\n",
        "![Semantic search image](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search/images/semantic_search.gif)\n",
        "\n",
        "Semantic search with embeddings and vector search can help make IT systems as smart as experienced librarians or shop staff. Embeddings can be used for tying different business data with their meanings; for example, queries and search results; texts and images; user activities and recommended products; English texts and Japanese texts; or sensor data and alerting conditions. With this capability, there's a wide variety of use cases for embeddings.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why combine semantic search with keyword-based search?\n",
        "\n",
        "Semantic search doesn't cover all the possible requirements for information retrieval applications, such as [Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://cloud.google.com/use-cases/retrieval-augmented-generation). Semantic search can only find data that the embedding model can make sense of. For example, queries or datasets with arbitrary product numbers or SKUs, brand new product names that were added recently, and corporate proprietary codenames don't work with semantic search because they aren't included in the training dataset of the embedding model. This is called \"out of domain\" data.\n",
        "\n",
        "In such cases, you would need to combine semantic search with keyword-based (also called token-based) search to form a hybrid search. With hybrid search, you can take advantage of both semantic and token-based search to achieve higher search quality.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the most popular hybrid search systems is Google Search. The service incorporated [semantic search in 2015 with RankBrain model](https://blog.google/products/search/how-ai-powers-great-search-results/), in addition to its token-based keyword search algorithm. With the introduction of hybrid search, Google Search was able to improve the search quality significantly by addressing the two requirements: search by meaning and search by keyword.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the past, building a hybrid search engine was a complex task. Just like with Google Search, you have to build and operate two different kinds of search engines (semantic search and token-based search) and merge and rank the results from them. With hybrid search support in Vector Search, you can build your own hybrid search system with a single Vector Search index, customized to your business requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "## How token-based search works\n",
        "\n",
        "How does token-based search in Vector Search work? After [splitting the text into tokens](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/tokenizer_summary) (such as words or sub-words), you can use popular sparse embedding algorithms such as [TF-IDF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf), [BM25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25), or [SPLADE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_sparse_retrieval) to generate sparse embedding for the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "A simplified explanation of sparse embeddings is that they are vectors that represent how many times each word or sub-word appears in the text. Typical sparse embeddings don't take semantics of the text into account.\n",
        "\n",
        "![Sparse embeddings image](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search/images/sparse_embeddings.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "There could be thousands of different words used in texts. Thus, this embedding usually has tens of thousands of dimensions, with only a few dimensions in them having non-zero values. This is why they're called \"sparse\" embeddings. The majority of their values are zeroes. This sparse embedding space works as a map of keywords, similar to an index of books.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this sparse embedding space, you can find similar embeddings by looking at the neighborhood of a query embedding. These embeddings are similar in terms of the distribution of the keywords used in their texts.\n",
        "\n",
        "![Token search image](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search/images/token_search.gif)\n",
        "\n",
        "This is the basic mechanism of the token-based search with sparse embeddings. With hybrid search in Vector Search, you can mix both dense and sparse embeddings into a single vector index and run queries with dense embeddings, sparse embeddings, or both. The result is a combination of semantic search and token-based search results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Hybrid search also provides shorter query latency compared to a token-based search engine with an [inverted index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverted_index) design. Just like vector search for semantic search, each query with dense or sparse embeddings finishes within milliseconds, even with millions or billions of items.\n"

[SPLADE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned_sparse_retrieval) is another popular vectorization algorithm that takes some semantics for the sparse embedding.\n",

        "## How do TF-IDF and `TfidfVectorizer` work?\n",
        "The `fit_transform()` function executes two important processes of the TF-IDF algorithm:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Fit**: The vectorizer calculates the Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) for each term in the vocabulary. IDF reflects how important a term is across the entire corpus. Rare terms get higher IDF scores:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "IDF(t) = log_e(Total number of documents / Number of documents containing term t)\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Transform**:\n",
        " - **Tokenization**: Breaks the documents down into individual terms (words or phrases)\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        " - **TF-IDF Calculation**: Combines the TF for each term with the pre-calculated IDF to create a TF-IDF score. This score represents the importance of a term in a particular document relative to the entire corpus.\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "TF-IDF(t, d) = TF(t, d) * IDF(t)\n",

        "The TF-IDF vectorizer tries to put higher weight to signature words in the dataset, such as \"Shirts\" or \"Dino\", compared to trivial words, such as \"The\", \"a\" or \"of\", and counts how many times those signature words are used in the specified document. Each value of a sparse embedding represents a frequency of each word based on the counts.\n",

        "## What is Reciprocal Rank Fusion?\n",
        "For merging the token-based and semantic search results, hybrid search uses [Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF)](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/%7Egvcormac/cormacksigir09-rrf.pdf). RRF is an algorithm for combining multiple ranked lists of items into a single, unified ranking. It's a popular technique for merging search results from different sources or retrieval methods, especially in hybrid search systems and large language models.\n",
        "\n",
        "In case of the hybrid search of Vector Search, the dense distance and sparse distance are measured in different spaces and can't be directly compared to each other. Thus, RRF works effectively for merging and ranking the results from the two different spaces.\n",

        "Here's how RRF Works:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Reciprocal rank**: For each item in a ranked list, calculate its reciprocal rank. This means taking the inverse of the item's position (rank) in the list. For example, the item ranked number one gets a reciprocal rank of 1/1 = 1, and the item ranked number two gets 1/2 = 0.5.\n",
        "- **Sum reciprocal ranks**: Sum the reciprocal ranks for each item across all the ranked lists. This gives a final score for each item.\n",
        "- **Sort by final score**: Sort the items by their final score in descending order. The items with the highest scores are considered the most relevant or important.\n",
        "\n",
        "In short, the items with higher ranks in both dense and sparse results will be pulled up to the top of the list. Thus, the item \"Google Blue Kids Sunglasses\" is at the top as it has higher ranks in both dense and sparse search results. Items like \"Google White Classic Youth Tee\" are low ranked as they only have ranks in the dense search result.\n",

        "## How the alpha parameter behaves\n",
        "The example of how to use hybrid search sets the parameter `rrf_ranking_alpha` as `0.5` when creating the `HybridQuery` object. You can specify a weight on ranking the dense and sparse search results using the following values for `rrf_ranking_alpha`:\n",
