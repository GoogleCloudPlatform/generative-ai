        "\n",
        "[Vector Search 2.0](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search-2/overview) is Google Cloud's fully managed, self-tuning vector database built on Google's [ScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors)](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/scann) algorithm - the same technology powering Google Search, YouTube, and Google Play.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Differentiators\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Zero Indexing to Billion-Scale Index**: Start developing immediately with zero indexing time using [kNN (k-Nearest Neighbors)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm), then scale to billions of vectors with millisec latency with Google-scale [ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbor)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search#Approximate_nearest_neighbor) indexes for production - all with the same API and same dataset\n",
        "- **Unified Data Storage**: Store both [vector embeddings](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/embeddings) and metadata together (no separate database or feature store needed)\n",
        "- **Auto-Embeddings**: Automatically generate semantic embeddings using [Vertex AI embedding models](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-text-embeddings#google-models)\n",
        "- **Built-in Full Text Search with [BM25](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okapi_BM25)**: Provides full-text keyword search without needing to generate sparse embeddings\n",
        "- **Hybrid Search**: Combine semantic and keyword/token-based search in a single query with intelligent [RRF](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/cormacksigir09-rrf.pdf) ranking\n",
        "- **Self-Tuning**: Auto-optimized performance without manual configuration\n",
        "- **Enterprise-Ready**: Built-in scalability, security, and compliance\n",

        "   - **Start fast**: Use kNN immediately with zero setup time - perfect for development and small datasets\n",

        "### 5. **Production-Ready Search** - ANN Indexes for Scale\n",
        "- Created ANN indexes powered by Google's ScaNN algorithm\n",
        "- Understood the kNN vs ANN trade-off (instant vs fast, exact vs approximate)\n",
        "- Learned how indexes automatically accelerate searches on indexed fields\n",
        "- Configured filter fields and store fields for optimized queries\n",
        "\n",
        "### 6. **Resource Management** - Cost Control\n",
        "- Properly deleted indexes before collections (order matters!)\n",
        "- Understood that collection deletion cascades to all data objects\n",
        "- Learned the importance of cleanup to avoid unexpected costs\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Takeaways\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ **Unified Storage**: Vectors + metadata together (no separate database needed)  \n",
        "✅ **Auto-Embeddings**: Automatic generation via Vertex AI models  \n",
        "✅ **Flexible Search**: Semantic, text, and hybrid search in one platform  \n",
