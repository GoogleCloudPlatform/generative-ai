    "## What is Vector Search 2.0?\n",
    "\n",
    "[Vector Search 2.0](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search-2/overview) is Google Cloud's fully managed, self-tuning vector database built on Google's [ScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors)](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/scann) algorithm - the same technology powering Google Search, YouTube, and Google Play.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differentiators\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Zero Indexing to Billion-Scale Index**: Start developing immediately with zero indexing time using [kNN (k-Nearest Neighbors)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm), then scale to billions of vectors with millisec latency with Google-scale [ANN (Approximate Nearest Neighbor)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest_neighbor_search#Approximate_nearest_neighbor) indexes for production - all with the same API and same dataset\n",
    "- **Unified Data Storage**: Store both [vector embeddings](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/generative-ai/embeddings) and user provided data together (no separate database or feature store needed)\n",
    "- **Auto-Embeddings**: Automatically generate semantic embeddings using [Vertex AI embedding models](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/get-text-embeddings#google-models)\n",
    "- **Built-in Full Text Search**: Provides a built-in [full-text search](https://cloud.google.com/discover/what-is-full-text-search?e=48754805&hl=en) without needing to generate sparse embeddings by yourself. You can also choose to use your own sparse embeddings (e.g., BM25, SPLADE) with Vector Search for a customized full-text search.\n",
    "- **Hybrid Search**: Combine semantic and keyword/token-based search in a single query with intelligent [RRF](https://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/cormacksigir09-rrf.pdf) ranking\n",
    "- **Self-Tuning**: Auto-optimized performance without manual configuration\n",
    "- **Enterprise-Ready**: Built-in scalability, security, and compliance\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector Search 2.0 has three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **[Collections](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search-2/collections/collections)**: Schema-enforced containers for your data\n",
    "2. **[Data Objects](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search-2/data-objects/data-objects)**: Individual items with data and vector embeddings\n",
    "3. **[Indexes](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search-2/indexes/indexes)**: Instant nearest neighbor search your data with kNN. For low latency nearest neighbor search use an ANN index.\n",
    "   - **Start fast**: Use kNN immediately with zero setup time - perfect for development and small datasets\n",
    "   - **Scale to production**: Use ANN indexes for billion-scale search with sub-second latency powered by ScaNN algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore each concept with hands-on examples!\n"

    "To demonstrate Vector Search 2.0's capabilities, we'll build a **product search and recommendation system** using the TheLook e-commerce dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "**For this demo**: We'll use a **3,000 product sample** for faster processing and lower costs. The techniques shown here scale seamlessly to the full dataset (~30K products) or even larger catalogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Business Use Cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Product Discovery**: Find similar products based on product name semantics\n",
    "2. **Semantic Search**: \"Find products similar to 'blue denim jeans'\"\n",
    "3. **Filtered Shopping**: \"Show me Dresses under $100\"\n",
    "4. **Hybrid Search**: Combine semantic similarity with keyword matching for better product recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "The full TheLook dataset contains **29,120 fashion products** from an e-commerce platform with the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `id`: Product ID (e.g., \"8037\")\n",
    "- `name`: Product name (e.g., \"Jostar Short Sleeve Solid Stretchy Capri Pants Set\")\n",
    "- `category`: Product category (26 categories: Dresses, Jeans, Tops & Tees, etc.)\n",
    "- `retail_price`: Product price in USD (e.g., 38.99)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sample Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "| ID | Name | Category | Price |\n",
    "|-----|------|----------|-------|\n",
    "| 8037 | Jostar Short Sleeve Solid Stretchy Capri Pants Set | Clothing Sets | $38.99 |\n",
    "| 8036 | Womens Top Stitch Jacket and Pant Set by City Lights | Clothing Sets | $199.95 |\n",
    "| 8035 | Ulla Popken Plus Size 3-Piece Duster and Pants Set | Clothing Sets | $159.00 |\n",

    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **[Data Schema](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search-2/collections/collections#data-schema)**: Defines the structure of your data ([JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) format). Note: We do not currently support `additionalProperties=True`.\n",
    "- **[Vector Schema](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search-2/collections/collections#vector-schema)**: Defines your embedding fields with their dimensions and types\n",
    "- **Schema Enforcement**: All Data Objects must conform to the defined schemas\n",
    "- **Multiple Embeddings**: You can have multiple vector fields per object (e.g., text_embedding, image_embedding)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Collection Features:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dense Vectors**: Standard continuous embeddings (e.g., [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...])\n",
    "3. **[Auto-Embeddings](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/vector-search-2/data-objects/data-objects#auto-populate-embeddings)**: Automatic embedding generation using Vertex AI models\n",

    "### Auto-Embeddings and Rate Limiting\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Rate Limiting is Necessary:**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create Data Objects with empty `vectors: {}`, Vector Search 2.0 automatically calls the Vertex AI Text Embeddings API to generate embeddings. For example, the `text-embeddings-004` model for the paid tier 1 project has a default quota limit of **3,000 requests per minute (RPM)**. You can check the quota limit on the [Quotas and system limits](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/quotas/view-manage) page on the Console.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What Happens Without Rate Limiting:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Without the `time.sleep(2.5)` delay, the batch import would attempt to create all 30 batches (3,000 products ÷ 100 per batch) in rapid succession, resulting in **3,000 embedding API calls in just a few seconds** - far exceeding the quota.\n",
    "\n",
    "You would see errors like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "429 Resource has been exhausted (e.g. check quota).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Rate Limiting Strategy:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Batch size**: 100 products = 100 embedding API calls per batch\n",
    "- **Delay**: 2.5 seconds between batches\n",
    "- **Effective rate**: 100 requests ÷ 2.5 seconds = 40 requests/second = **2,400 RPM** (80% of quota)\n",
    "\n",
    "This keeps us safely under the 3,000 RPM limit while still processing products efficiently. For the full 3,000 product dataset, the import takes approximately **75 seconds** (30 batches × 2.5 seconds).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the current quota is not enough for your dataset, you can request [a Quota adjustment](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/quotas/view-manage#requesting_higher_quota). After increasing the limit, you can adjust the rate limiting delay based on the new limit.\n",

    "- **Scalability**: Same code works for 3K products or 3 billion products\n",
    "- **Speed**: Sub-second latency even at massive scale vs. seconds/minutes with kNN\n",

    "# Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've completed a comprehensive introduction to **Vertex AI Vector Search 2.0**. Let's recap what you've learned and where to go next.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You've Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Collections** - Schema-Enforced Data Containers\n",
    "- Created Collections with data schemas (data) and vector schemas (embeddings)\n",
    "- Configured auto-embeddings using Vertex AI's `text-embedding-004` model\n",
    "- Learned how Collections enforce data structure for consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Data Objects** - Your Actual Data\n",
    "- Created individual Data Objects with data and vectors\n",
    "- Used batch operations for efficient bulk imports (100x faster than individual creates)\n",
    "- Implemented rate limiting to stay within API quotas (3,000 RPM for embeddings)\n",
    "- Understood how auto-embeddings work with empty `vectors: {}`\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Querying and Filtering** - SQL-Like Metadata Search\n",
    "- Used query operators (`$eq`, `$lt`, `$gte`, `$and`, `$or`) to filter data\n",
    "- Retrieved products by category, price range, and complex conditions\n",
    "- Performed aggregate queries to get collection statistics\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **Vector Search** - Semantic Similarity with kNN\n",
    "- **Semantic Search**: Natural language queries with auto-generated embeddings\n",
    "- **Text Search**: Traditional keyword matching\n",
    "- **Hybrid Search**: Combined semantic + text search with manual RRF ranking\n",
    "- Learned when to use kNN (development, small datasets) vs when to scale to ANN\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **Production-Ready Search** - ANN Indexes for Scale\n",
    "- Created ANN indexes powered by Google's ScaNN algorithm\n",
    "- Understood the kNN vs ANN trade-off (instant vs fast, exact vs approximate)\n",
    "- Learned how indexes automatically accelerate searches on indexed fields\n",
    "- Configured filter fields and store fields for optimized queries\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **Resource Management** - Cost Control\n",
    "- Properly deleted indexes before collections (order matters!)\n",
    "- Understood that collection deletion cascades to all data objects\n",
    "- Learned the importance of cleanup to avoid unexpected costs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Unified Storage**: Vectors + user provided data together (no separate database needed)  \n",
    "✅ **Auto-Embeddings**: Automatic generation via Vertex AI models  \n",
    "✅ **Flexible Search**: Semantic, text, and hybrid search in one platform  \n",
    "✅ **Development to Production**: Start with kNN, scale with ANN indexes  \n",
    "✅ **Battle-Tested Technology**: Built on ScaNN (powers Google Search, YouTube, Google Play)  \n",
    "✅ **Enterprise-Ready**: Scalability from 3K to 3B vectors with same API\n",
