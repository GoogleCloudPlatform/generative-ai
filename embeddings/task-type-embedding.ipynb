        "Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is becoming a very popular architecture pattern of LLM grounding that retrieves and feed relevant business data to LLM and suppress hallucinations. But many RAG engineers are struggling on building the production quality retrieval engine - the search quality of RAG systems is becoming a common big challenge. In many cases, this happens when you are using \"plain vanilla\" text embeddings with vector databases for a simple similarity search. This is actually a common fault of information retrieval system design that Google has been solving for our search services for over a decade.\n",

        "When building Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, most designs we've seen use text embedding and vector search to conduct a [semantic similarity search](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/how-to-use-grounding-for-your-llms-with-text-embeddings). In many cases, this leads to degraded search quality, because of the \"question is not the answer\" problem. For example, a question like \"Why is the sky blue?\" and its answer, \"The scattering of sunlight causes the blue color\", have distinctly different meanings as separate statements. Likewise, if you ask \"What's the best birthday present for my kid?\" to a RAG system with a similarity search, it would be hard to find items like \"Nintendo Switch\" or \"Lego sets\", as those answers are not semantically similar to the question.\n",

        "### The history of \"filling the gap\"\n",
        "\n",
        "This is actually a classic problem of semantic search for information retrieval, and Google has a long history of optimizing the semantic search quality for billions of users. Google Search started incorporating semantic search in 2015, with the introduction of [AI search innovations](https://blog.google/products/search/how-ai-powers-great-search-results/) like our deep learning ranking system RankBrain. This innovation was quickly followed with neural matching to improve the accuracy of document retrieval in Search. Neural matching contains deep learning models that learn the relationship between the query intention and relevant documents. For example, a search \"insights how to manage a green\". If a friend asked you this, you'd probably be stumped. But with neural matching, we're able to make sense of it.\n",

The following diagram depicts how a dual encoder model maps queries with relevant documents.\n",

        "But it is not easy to design, train and build a production retrieval system with a customized dual encoder model. It requires data science and ML engineering experience, and significant effort to train a dataset with pairs of questions and answers.\n",
        "\n",
        "### LLM-based \"Advanced RAG\"\n",
        "In the era of Large Language Models (LLM), some \"Advanced RAG\" approaches emerged to solve this problem. [HyDE](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10496) uses LLM reasoning capabilities to generate possible answer texts, and use the text for similarity search. Additionally, [query expansion with LLM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03653) uses the LLM reasoning for expanding the original query with possible answer candidates as query texts.\n",
        "\n",
        "The downside of these LLM-based approaches is that it adds the LLM prediction latency and high cost for every query. While the vector search itself can finish within milliseconds, and can handle thousands of queries per second at low cost, the LLM reasoning will add a few seconds latency for every single query with significantly higher cost than generating embeddings.\n",
        "\n",
        "## New \"task type\" embedding\n",
        "\n",
        "Recently [Vertex AI Embeddings API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings) launched new text embedding models, `text-embedding-004` and `text-multilingual-embedding-002` based on [the new embedding models](https://deepmind.google/research/publications/85521/) developed by the Google DeepMind and Research team.\n",
        "\n",
        "The unique feature of these models is that they can generate optimized embeddings based on [task types](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/embeddings/task-types). With task types, you can significantly reduce the time and cost for developing dual encoder models or advanced RAG systems for achieving higher search quality, for specific tasks including question and answering, document retrieval by query, fact verification, etc.\n",
        "For example, to generate embeddings for question and answering, all you have to do is to specify a task type `QUESTION_ANSWERING` for query texts and `RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT` for answer texts when generating their embeddings. In the embedding space optimized with the task types, the query embedding \"Why is the sky blue?\" and the answer embedding \"The scattering...\" will be placed in a much closer area, because the embedding models are trained to learn that they have the question and answer relationship. Thus you should be able to get higher search quality with vector databases to find the right answer for the query.\n",

        "\n",
        "How do the new embedding models enable this? The novel part of the model design is that the Google DeepMind and Research team used [LLM distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531) (a process to train a smaller model from a larger model) to pre-train a dual encoder based embedding model.\n",
        "Here's the distillation steps. The team used an LLM for generating two kinds of data: 1) synthetic queries and 2) query-and-document pairs. First, the team generated numerous synthetic queries from the training dataset (corpus) for each task.\n",

        "![](https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/embeddings/task_type_embeddings/6.%20FRet_2.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "With those pairs, the team trained a dual-encoder based embedding model. The result is an embedding model that inherits the reasoning capability of the LLM as a distilled model for the specific tasks. Significantly smaller, faster and inexpensive to generate embeddings, and yet, provides the capability of smart matching between queries and relevant documents.\n",

        "One caveat of task type embedding is that, the model is trained with generic corpus on the web. That means, the model may be less effective on use cases such as retrieving company proprietary document or question and answering on topics that the model doesn't know. In such cases, [Tune text embeddings](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/tune-embeddings) could provide better option than using the pre-trained model.\n",
