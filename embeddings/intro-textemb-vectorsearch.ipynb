As we are just retrieving the business data and not generating any artificial texts, there is no risk of having hallucinations in the result.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "In these cases, the simple semantics search don't work well. It's more like a recommendation system problem where you may want to train a model (e.g. Two-Tower model) to learn the relationship between the question embedding space and answer embedding space. Also, many production systems adds reranking phase after the semantic search to achieve higher search quality.
