        "## Overview: Agentspace Answer Evaluation\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating the quality of answers generated by an Agentspace application. It compares the Agentspace output against a \"golden dataset\" of expected answers using several widely recognized natural language processing (NLP) metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Target Audience:** Developers and researchers working with Agentspace applications who need to quantitatively assess the performance of their answer generation models.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Features:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Metric-Based Evaluation:** Utilizes established NLP metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, and Semantic Similarity to provide a robust evaluation.\n",
        "*   **Google Sheets Integration:** Seamlessly loads the golden dataset from a specified Google Sheet and can output the evaluation results back to a sheet.\n",
        "*   **BigQuery Integration:** Provides an option to save the evaluation results to a BigQuery table for further analysis and historical tracking.\n",
        "*   **Agentspace API Interaction:** Includes helper functions to interact with Agentspace Search and Assist APIs to fetch answers for evaluation.\n",
        "*   **Qualitative Rating:** Maps the numerical scores from the metrics to a qualitative rating (e.g., Excellent, Good) for easier interpretation.\n",
        "*   **Configurable:** Allows users to configure project details, engine ID, application type, and input/output sheet URLs.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Evaluation Framework:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The notebook employs a multi-faceted evaluation approach using the following NLP metrics:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy):** Measures the n-gram overlap between the generated answer and the expected answer. It is a precision-focused metric, indicating how much of the generated text is present in the reference.\n",
        "*   **ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation):** A set of metrics that measure the overlap of n-grams, word sequences, and word pairs between the generated answer and the expected answer. It is a recall-focused metric, indicating how much of the reference text is covered by the generated text. The notebook specifically uses ROUGE-L, which measures the longest common subsequence.\n",
        "*   **BERTScore:** Leverages pre-trained BERT embeddings to compute a similarity score between the generated answer and the expected answer. It considers semantic similarity beyond simple word overlap, making it more robust to paraphrasing.\n",
        "*   **Semantic Similarity:** Calculates the semantic similarity between the generated answer and the expected answer using a Sentence Transformer model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`). This provides a measure of how similar the meaning of the two texts is, regardless of the exact wording.\n",
        "\n",
        "For each question in the golden dataset, the notebook calculates these four scores. A qualitative rating (Excellent, Good, Moderate, Low, Poor) is then assigned based on the average of the BLEU, ROUGE, and BERT scores, and also individually for the Semantic Similarity score. This provides both numerical and easily interpretable qualitative feedback on the performance of the Agentspace application.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Input and Output Options:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Input (Golden Dataset):** The golden dataset, containing the test queries and their corresponding expected answers, is loaded from a Google Sheet. You need to provide the Google Drive URL of your sheet and the name of the worksheet containing the data. The notebook expects at least two columns: one for the query/question and one for the expected answer. Column names MUST be `search_query` and `expected answers`\n",
        "\n",
        "Sample:\n",
        "\n",
        "| `search_query` | `expected_answers` |\n",
        "|----------------|--------------------|\n",
        "|                |                    |\n",
        "|                |                    |\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Output (Evaluation Results):** The evaluation results, including the calculated scores (BLEU, ROUGE, BERTScore, Semantic Similarity) and their corresponding qualitative ratings for each question, can be saved in the following formats:\n",
        "    *   **CSV File:** The results are saved to a local CSV file within the Colab environment.\n",
        "    *   **Google Sheet:** The results can be written to a specified worksheet within your Google Sheet. The notebook handles the case where the worksheet already exists.\n",
        "    *   **BigQuery Table:** The results can be appended to a BigQuery table, including a timestamp for each run, allowing for historical tracking and further analysis using BigQuery's capabilities. You need to provide the dataset ID and table name.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How to Use:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Setup:** Provide your Google Cloud project details, Agentspace engine ID, and the URLs for your golden dataset Google Sheet, as well as the desired BigQuery dataset and table names if using that option.\n",
        "2.  **Authentication:** Authenticate your Google Cloud account and enable the necessary APIs (Discovery Engine, Sheets, Drive, BigQuery).\n",
        "3.  **Data Loading:** The notebook will fetch your golden dataset from the specified Google Sheet.\n",
        "4.  **Answer Retrieval:** The notebook will query your Agentspace application with the questions from the golden dataset to get the generated answers.\n",
        "5.  **Evaluation:** The notebook will compute the specified NLP metrics by comparing the generated answers to the expected answers in your golden dataset.\n",
        "6.  **Results:** The results, including the scores and qualitative ratings, will be saved to the configured output options (CSV, Google Sheet, and/or BigQuery).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Prerequisites:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Access to a Google Cloud project.\n",
        "*   An Agentspace application (Search or Assist).\n",
        "*   A Google Sheet containing your golden dataset with at least two columns: one for the query/question and one for the expected answer.\n",
        "*   Necessary APIs enabled in your Google Cloud project (Discovery Engine, Sheets, Drive, BigQuery).\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook can be easily adapted to evaluate other answer generation systems by modifying the helper functions to interact with the relevant APIs."

        "## Learnings and Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "### What We Learned\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook provided a comprehensive framework for evaluating the quality of answers generated by an Agentspace application. Our process involved several key stages:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Environment Setup and Configuration:**\n",
        "    *   We successfully installed and imported all necessary libraries for data manipulation (pandas), NLP evaluation (NLTK, rouge-score, bert-score, sentence-transformers), and Google Cloud integration (google-cloud-discoveryengine, gspread, google-auth).\n",
        "    *   We configured essential parameters, including Google Cloud project details, Agentspace engine ID, application type (search/assist), and locations for input (Google Sheets) and output (CSV, Google Sheets, BigQuery).\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  **Data Ingestion and Answer Retrieval:**\n",
        "    *   The notebook demonstrated how to load a \"golden dataset\" containing queries and their expected answers from a Google Sheet.\n",
        "    *   We utilized helper functions to interact with the Agentspace Discovery Engine APIs (specifically `get_answer_results` in the main flow) to retrieve answers generated by the Agentspace application for each query in our golden dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Metric-Based Evaluation:**\n",
        "    *   We implemented a robust evaluation methodology using four distinct NLP metrics:\n",
        "        *   **BLEU Score:** To measure n-gram precision against reference answers.\n",
        "        *   **ROUGE-L Score:** To measure recall based on the longest common subsequence.\n",
        "        *   **BERTScore:** To assess semantic similarity using contextual embeddings, going beyond lexical overlap.\n",
        "        *   **Semantic Similarity:** Calculated using the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` Sentence Transformer model to capture the similarity in meaning between generated and expected answers.\n",
        "    *   For each query, we computed these four scores by comparing the Agentspace-generated answer with the corresponding expected answer.\n",
        "    *   A qualitative rating system (Excellent, Good, Moderate, Low, Poor) was applied to the numerical scores, providing an easily interpretable assessment of answer quality for each metric.\n",
        "\n",
        "4.  **Results Storage and Reporting:**\n",
        "    *   The evaluation results, including the raw scores, qualitative ratings, original queries, expected answers, and actual answers, were compiled into a structured Pandas DataFrame.\n",
        "    *   A timestamp was added to each evaluation run for tracking purposes.\n",
        "    *   The notebook demonstrated multiple ways to persist these results:\n",
        "        *   Saving to a local CSV file.\n",
        "        *   Writing to a new or existing worksheet in a Google Sheet.\n",
        "        *   Appending to a BigQuery table, enabling historical analysis and more complex querying. The notebook also handled the creation of the BigQuery dataset and table if they didn't already exist.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook successfully establishes a repeatable and quantitative process for evaluating the performance of an Agentspace application's answer generation capabilities. By leveraging a golden dataset and a suite of established NLP metrics, we can:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Objectively measure answer quality:** Moving beyond subjective assessments to data-driven insights.\n",
        "*   **Identify areas for improvement:** Pinpoint queries or types of queries where the Agentspace application may be underperforming.\n",
        "*   **Track performance over time:** By storing results (especially in BigQuery), we can monitor how changes to the Agentspace configuration, underlying data, or models impact answer quality.\n",
        "*   **Benchmark different configurations:** The framework can be used to compare the performance of different Agentspace engine settings or versions.\n",
        "\n",
        "The integration with Google Sheets and BigQuery makes the golden dataset management and results analysis highly accessible and scalable. The qualitative ratings alongside numerical scores offer a balanced view, catering to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Potential Next Steps:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Automate the evaluation pipeline:** Integrate this notebook into a CI/CD pipeline for regular, automated performance checks.\n",
        "*   **Expand the golden dataset:** Continuously add more diverse and challenging queries to the golden dataset for more comprehensive testing.\n",
        "*   **Error Analysis:** Perform a deeper dive into queries with low scores to understand the root causes of poor performance (e.g., issues with grounding, summarization, or relevance).\n",
        "*   **Experiment with different models/settings:** Use this evaluation framework to systematically test the impact of different Agentspace configurations or underlying LLMs.\n",
        "*   **Visualize results:** Create dashboards (e.g., in Looker Studio using BigQuery data) to visualize evaluation trends and key metrics.\n",
        "\n",
        "This evaluation framework is a valuable asset for anyone looking to rigorously assess and improve their Agentspace applications."
