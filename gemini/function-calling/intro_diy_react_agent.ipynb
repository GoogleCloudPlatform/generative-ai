    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook illustrates that at its simplest, a ReAct agent is a piece of code that coordinates between reasoning and acting, where:\n",
    "- The reasoning is carried out by the language model\n",
    "- The application code performs the acting, at the instruction of the language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows problems to be solved by letting a model 'think' through the tasks step-by-step, taking actions and getting action feedback before determining the next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div>\n",
    "    <table align=\"center\">\n",

    "    </table>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "This coordination between the language model and the environment is made possible by asking the language model to communicate the intended actions in a specific and structured manner. The response is 'specific' in that the list of possible actions are predefined functions and thus necessarily constrained. The response is also 'structured', so the function parameters given in the response can be used directly by the application code, minimizing the need for further parsing, interpretation, or transformations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both requirements can be supported by many language models, as they are equivalent to performing natural language tasks such as classification and information extraction. As illustrated in the first two examples in this notebook, the task of identifying suitable function names and extraction of function parameters can be done using prompting and response parsing alone. \n",
    "\n",
    "For strengthened quality on the function call responses  however, in terms of validity, reliability, and consistency, many models now feature built-in APIs supporting 'Function Calling' or 'Tools Calling' (these terms are often used interchangeably). Such built-in support reduces the amount of defensive safeguards a developer has to build around response handling in their applications. "

    "### Function / Tool-Calling APIs and Agent Frameworks\n",
    "\n",
    "In the third example in this notebook, we leverage [Function Calling in Gemini](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/function-calling) to build our simple agent. It lets developers create a description of a function in their code, then pass that description to a language model in a request. The response from the model includes the name of a function that matches the description and the arguments to call it with.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also other tools-calling and agents building frameworks to increase developers productivity. For example, the [Tool-Calling Agents](https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/agents/agent_types/tool_calling/) from Langchain, and at an even higher level of abstraction, [Reasoning Engine](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/reasoning-engine/overview) is a Google Cloud managed service that helps you to build and deploy an agent reasoning framework ([See sample notebooks](https://github.com/gkcng/generative-ai/blob/gkcng-demo/gemini/reasoning-engine)). Reasoning Engine integrates closely with the Python SDK for the Gemini model in Vertex AI, and it can manage prompts, agents, and examples in a modular way. Reasoning Engine is compatible with LangChain, LlamaIndex, or other Python frameworks. "

    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the basic building blocks of function calling and its utility, this notebook illustrates building the same agent with Gemini in three different ways, via:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prompting alone - using the single turn `generate_content` API. \n",
    "1. Prompting alone - using the `ChatSession` API instead.\n",
    "1. Function Calling - Modified from the `ChatSession` example.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first example, the list of possible functions are presented to the API every time because the API is stateless. In the second example, because the `ChatSession` is stateful on the client side, we only need to present the list of function choices at the beginning of the session. The first two examples will introduce to the audience the building blocks that are now reliably supported by Gemini and many other model APIs as 'Tool' / 'Function' calling, and the Gemini API is demonstrated in the third example. \n",
    "\n",
    "The raw prompting examples are only used to explain the building blocks and help understand the dedicated APIs. For your productivity and reliability of responses you are encouraged to use an API that supports function calling. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the first example, we also illustrate the concept of explicit goal checking vs model-based goal checking. Use explicit goal checking when the goal can easily be define in code, it can save some cost and improves speed. Otherwise use model-based goal checking when the goal is too complex or variable, and specifying the goal in natural language and let the model handle the interpretation is simpler and faster than writing the full checks in code."
