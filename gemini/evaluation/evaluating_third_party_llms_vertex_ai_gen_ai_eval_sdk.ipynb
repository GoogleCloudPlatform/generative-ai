        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates how to use the new Vertex Gen AI Evaluation SDK to evaluate various types of third-party models. Whether you're working with open models you've deployed yourself, models hosted on other platforms, or managed model services available in the Model Garden, this SDK provides a unified way to assess their performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will explore four main scenarios:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Evaluating Third-Party Models via APIs:** This method is ideal for accessing closed-source models from various third-party (3P) providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, etc. These models are typically accessed via an API key. The Vertex AI GenAI Evaluation SDK integrates with the `litellm` library, which acts as a universal translator, allowing you to call over 100 different LLM APIs using a consistent format. You simply need to provide the appropriate API key for the service you wish to use (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY` for OpenAI models like `gpt-5`) and Vertex AI GenAI Evaluation SDK handles the provider-specific API calls. For a full list of supported providers and model string formats, refer to the [LiteLLM Supported Providers](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/providers) page.\n",
        "   \n",
        "\n",
        "2.   **Model as a Service (MaaS) from Model Garden:** Evaluating partner models, such as `llama-4` from Meta, which are offered as managed services within Vertex AI Model Garden. These models often utilize an OpenAI-compatible API format for inference.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  **Bring Your Own Model (BYOM) Endpoint:**  This method supports evaluating models that you manage and serve independently. This could be on your own hardware, a different cloud service, or a local machine. To integrate with the Vertex AI Evaluation SDK, you implement a Python function that knows how to communicate with your model's specific serving endpoint to generate responses for given prompts.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Throughout this tutorial, we will use the `vertexai` SDK's new `Client` interface, which provides a streamlined way to interact with Vertex AI services, including the GenAI Evaluation Service.\n"
