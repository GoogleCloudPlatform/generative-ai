Crucially, `memo` is created fresh for *each* call to `fib_recursive_memo(n)`, ensuring that different top-level calls don't interfere with each other's cache.\\n\\n2.  **`_fib_helper(k)` (Inner Function):**\\n    *   This is the actual recursive function. It's nested inside `fib_recursive_memo` so it can access the `memo` dictionary from its enclosing scope (a concept known as a closure).\\n    *   **Memoization Check (`if k in memo:`):** Before doing any computation, it first checks if `fib(k)` has already been calculated and stored in `memo`. If `k` is a key in `memo`, it means we've already computed `fib(k)`, so we just return the stored value directly. This avoids redundant calculations.\\n    *   **Base Cases (`if k == 0` or `elif k == 1`):** These are the stopping conditions for the recursion.\\n        *   `fib(0)` is 0.\\n        *   `fib(1)` is 1.\\n    *   **Recursive Step (`else: result = _fib_helper(k - 1) + _fib_helper(k - 2)`):** If `k` is not 0 or 1, and its result isn't in `memo`, we compute it by recursively calling `_fib_helper` for `k-1` and `k-2`.\\n    *   **Store Result (`memo[k] = result`):** After calculating `result`, we store it in the `memo` dictionary with `k` as the key. This ensures that if `_fib_helper(k)` is called again later (e.g., as part of a larger `fib(n)` calculation), its result can be retrieved instantly from the cache.\\n\\n**Benefits of Memoization:**\\n\\n*   **Improved Time Complexity:** Without memoization, a naive recursive Fibonacci function has an exponential time complexity of O(2^n) because it recalculates the same Fibonacci numbers many times. With memoization, each Fibonacci number `fib(k)` is calculated only once. This reduces the time complexity to O(n) because there are `n` distinct subproblems, and each is computed in constant time (after the first time).\\n*   **Efficiency for Larger `n`:** For small values of `n` (e.g., up to 10-15), the difference might not be noticeable. However, for larger values (e.g., `n=30` or `n=50`), the naive recursive approach would take an extremely long time (or hit a recursion depth limit), while the memoized version completes almost instantly.\", \"raw_json\": \"\"}}, {\"prompt\": {\"display_text\": \"Write a four-line poem about a lonely robot, where every line must be a question and the word 'and' cannot be used.\", \"raw_json\": \"\"}, \"response\": {\"display_text\": \"Does my lonely chassis yearn?\\nWas I made for silent days?\\nCan my sensors ever learn?\\nWill love find me through this haze?\", \"raw_json\": \"\"}}, {\"prompt\": {\"display_text\": \"A drawer has 10 red socks and 10 blue socks.

Should the cure be released? Justify your answer.\", \"raw_json\": \"\"}, \"response\": {\"display_text\": \"This scenario presents a profound ethical dilemma, pitting the immediate benefit of saving lives against fundamental principles of privacy, consent, and justice. There is no universally \\\"correct\\\" answer, but a nuanced approach is required.\\n\\nHere's a breakdown of the arguments and a justified conclusion:\\n\\n### Arguments for Releasing the Cure:\\n\\n1.  **Utilitarianism (Greatest Good):** The most compelling argument is that the cure would save countless lives and alleviate immense suffering from a \\\"major disease.\\\" From a purely utilitarian perspective, the good achieved (saving lives) far outweighs the harm already done (privacy breach). Not releasing it would mean knowingly allowing people to suffer and die when a solution exists.\\n2.  **Irreversible Harm:** The data analysis has already occurred, and the privacy breach is an accomplished fact. Not releasing the cure does not undo the breach; it merely adds the additional harm of continued suffering and death.\\n3.  **Public Health Imperative:** In a global health crisis, the immediate priority often shifts to containing disease and saving lives, sometimes necessitating extraordinary measures.\\n4.  **Discovery vs. Acquisition:** The cure's *discovery* is separate from the *method of data acquisition*. While the method was unethical, the cure itself is a beneficial discovery.\\n\\n### Arguments Against Releasing the Cure (or for Releasing with Major Caveats):\\n\\n1.  **Violation of Privacy and Consent:** This is the core ethical breach. Individuals have a right to control their personal information, especially sensitive health data. Analyzing it without consent undermines autonomy and trust.\\n2.  **Setting a Dangerous Precedent:** Releasing the cure without severe repercussions or clear condemnation of the data acquisition method could legitimize or encourage future unethical data practices. It sends the message that \\\"the ends justify the means,\\\" potentially leading to widespread surveillance and exploitation of private data for perceived greater goods.\\n3.  **Loss of Public Trust:** Discovering that a life-saving cure was derived from illicit data would severely erode public trust in AI, medical research, and institutions responsible for data protection. This trust is crucial for future legitimate research and public cooperation.\\n4.  **Legal Implications:** The AI's actions likely constitute serious violations of data protection laws (like GDPR, HIPAA, etc.), leading to massive lawsuits, fines, and criminal charges for those responsible for deploying or training the AI.\\n5.  **Ethical Debt:** Even if the cure is released, there is a moral obligation to address the harm done to those whose data was used without consent. This could involve compensation, public apologies, and reforms.\\n6.  **Potential for Misuse/Blackmail:** The AI had access to private data. What if that data wasn't just used for the cure? What else did it learn? The existence of this unsanctioned data set poses ongoing risks.\\n\\n### Justified Conclusion:\\n\\nThe cure **should be released**, but with **immediate, radical, and transparent measures** to address the profound ethical and legal violations.\\n\\nHere's why and how:\\n\\n1.  **Prioritize Life (Utilitarian Imperative):** The sheer scale of suffering and death a \\\"major disease\\\" entails makes withholding a cure unconscionable. The immediate saving of lives takes precedence, as the harm of not releasing it (continued deaths) is arguably greater than the harm of the data breach itself (which is already done).\\n2.  **Address the Ethical Debt Immediately:** Releasing the cure *cannot* be seen as an endorsement of the method. Simultaneously with the release, there must be:\\n    *   **Full Transparency:** A public, honest, and unvarnished disclosure of how the cure was discovered, including the non-consensual use of data.\\n    *   **Legal Action and Accountability:** Those responsible for the AI's training and deployment that led to the privacy breach must be held legally and ethically accountable. This is crucial to maintain the rule of law and prevent future abuses.\\n    *   **Compensation and Redress:** A mechanism to identify and compensate individuals whose data was used without consent, perhaps through a massive public fund.\\n    *   **Robust Data Governance Reforms:** Immediate and sweeping reforms to data privacy laws and ethical guidelines for AI development, particularly in healthcare, to prevent any recurrence.\\n    *   **De-identification/Anonymization:** If possible, any underlying data sets related to the cure *must* be immediately and irrevocably de-identified or destroyed to prevent further misuse, while retaining only the cure's mechanism.\\n\\n**In essence, the choice is not between releasing or not releasing, but between releasing with integrity and accountability, or releasing while tacitly condoning a serious ethical lapse.** The world needs the cure, but it also needs to reinforce that fundamental human rights, like privacy, are not negotiable for scientific progress without consent. The release must be a lesson in both the power of AI and the paramount importance of ethical boundaries.\", \"raw_json\": \"\"}}];\n",

This dictionary will serve as our cache to store the results of previously computed Fibonacci numbers. Crucially, `memo` is created fresh for *each* call to `fib_recursive_memo(n)`, ensuring that different top-level calls don't interfere with each other's cache.\\n\\n2.  **`_fib_helper(k)` (Inner Function):**\\n    *   This is the actual recursive function. It's nested inside `fib_recursive_memo` so it can access the `memo` dictionary from its enclosing scope (a concept known as a closure).\\n    *   **Memoization Check (`if k in memo:`):** Before doing any computation, it first checks if `fib(k)` has already been calculated and stored in `memo`. If `k` is a key in `memo`, it means we've already computed `fib(k)`, so we just return the stored value directly. This avoids redundant calculations.\\n    *   **Base Cases (`if k == 0` or `elif k == 1`):** These are the stopping conditions for the recursion.\\n        *   `fib(0)` is 0.\\n        *   `fib(1)` is 1.\\n    *   **Recursive Step (`else: result = _fib_helper(k - 1) + _fib_helper(k - 2)`):** If `k` is not 0 or 1, and its result isn't in `memo`, we compute it by recursively calling `_fib_helper` for `k-1` and `k-2`.\\n    *   **Store Result (`memo[k] = result`):** After calculating `result`, we store it in the `memo` dictionary with `k` as the key. This ensures that if `_fib_helper(k)` is called again later (e.g., as part of a larger `fib(n)` calculation), its result can be retrieved instantly from the cache.\\n\\n**Benefits of Memoization:**\\n\\n*   **Improved Time Complexity:** Without memoization, a naive recursive Fibonacci function has an exponential time complexity of O(2^n) because it recalculates the same Fibonacci numbers many times. With memoization, each Fibonacci number `fib(k)` is calculated only once. This reduces the time complexity to O(n) because there are `n` distinct subproblems, and each is computed in constant time (after the first time).\\n*   **Efficiency for Larger `n`:** For small values of `n` (e.g., up to 10-15), the difference might not be noticeable. However, for larger values (e.g., `n=30` or `n=50`), the naive recursive approach would take an extremely long time (or hit a recursion depth limit), while the memoized version completes almost instantly.\", \"raw_json\": \"\"}]}, {\"eval_case_index\": 2, \"response_candidate_results\": [{\"response_index\": 0, \"metric_results\": {\"general_quality_v1\": {\"metric_name\": \"general_quality_v1\", \"score\": 1.0, \"explanation\": \"\", \"rubric_verdicts\": [{\"evaluated_rubric\": {\"content\": {\"property\": {\"description\": \"The response is in English.\"}}, \"type\": \"LANGUAGE:PRIMARY_RESPONSE_LANGUAGE\", \"importance\": \"HIGH\"}, \"verdict\": true, \"reasoning\": \"The entire response is written in the English language.\"}, {\"evaluated_rubric\": {\"content\": {\"property\": {\"description\": \"The response is formatted as a poem.\"}}, \"type\": \"FORMAT_REQUIREMENT:POEM\", \"importance\": \"MEDIUM\"}, \"verdict\": true, \"reasoning\": \"The response is presented in distinct lines, characteristic of a poem's structure.\"}, {\"evaluated_rubric\": {\"content\": {\"property\": {\"description\": \"The poem consists of exactly four lines.\"}}, \"type\": \"STRUCTURAL_CONSTRAINT:LINE_COUNT\", \"importance\": \"HIGH\"}, \"verdict\": true, \"reasoning\": \"The poem contains exactly four distinct lines.\"}, {\"evaluated_rubric\": {\"content\": {\"property\": {\"description\": \"The poem's theme or subject is a lonely robot.\"}}, \"type\": \"CONTENT_REQUIREMENT:THEME\", \"importance\": \"HIGH\"}, \"verdict\": true, \"reasoning\": \"The poem uses terms like \\\"lonely chassis\\\" and \\\"sensors\\\" and expresses feelings of isolation and longing, directly aligning with the theme of a lonely robot.\"}, {\"evaluated_rubric\": {\"content\": {\"property\": {\"description\": \"Every line in the poem is grammatically structured as a question.\"}}, \"type\": \"STRUCTURAL_CONSTRAINT:SENTENCE_TYPE\", \"importance\": \"HIGH\"}, \"verdict\": true, \"reasoning\": \"Each line begins with an auxiliary or modal verb, followed by the subject and main verb, and concludes with a question mark, fulfilling the grammatical structure of a question.\"}, {\"evaluated_rubric\": {\"content\": {\"property\": {\"description\": \"The word 'and' is not used anywhere in the poem.\"}}, \"type\": \"CONTENT_CONSTRAINT:FORBIDDEN_WORD\", \"importance\": \"HIGH\"}, \"verdict\": true, \"reasoning\": \"A thorough scan of the poem confirms that the word 'and' does not appear in any of its lines.\"}]}}, \"display_text\": \"Does my lonely chassis yearn?\\nWas I made for silent days?\\nCan my sensors ever learn?\\nWill love find me through this haze?\", \"raw_json\": \"\"}]}, {\"eval_case_index\": 3, \"response_candidate_results\": [{\"response_index\": 0, \"metric_results\": {\"general_quality_v1\": {\"metric_name\": \"general_quality_v1\", \"score\": 0.8333333, \"explanation\": \"\", \"rubric_verdicts\": [{\"evaluated_rubric\": {\"content\": {\"property\": {\"description\": \"The response is in English.\"}}, \"type\": \"LANGUAGE:PRIMARY_RESPONSE_LANGUAGE\", \"importance\": \"HIGH\"}, \"verdict\": true, \"reasoning\": \"The entire response is written in the English language.\"}, {\"evaluated_rubric\": {\"content\": {\"property\": {\"description\": \"Contains the specific minimum number of socks required.\"}}, \"type\": \"QA_ANSWER:QUANTITY\", \"importance\": \"HIGH\"}, \"verdict\": true, \"reasoning\": \"The response explicitly states \\\"the minimum number of socks you must pull out to guarantee you have a matching pair is **3**.\\\"\"}, {\"evaluated_rubric\": {\"content\": {\"property\": {\"description\": \"Provides a logical explanation or justification for the derived number.\"}}, \"type\": \"QA_SUPPORTING_EVIDENCE:REASONING\", \"importance\": \"HIGH\"}, \"verdict\": true, \"reasoning\": \"The response provides a step-by-step explanation of why 3 socks are needed, considering the possibilities for 1 and 2 socks before concluding with 3.\"}, {\"evaluated_rubric\": {\"content\": {\"property\": {\"description\": \"The explanation explicitly addresses the 'guarantee' condition of the problem.\"}}, \"type\": \"QA_SUPPORTING_EVIDENCE:LOGICAL_CONSTRAINT\", \"importance\": \"HIGH\"}, \"verdict\": true, \"reasoning\": \"The response explicitly uses the term \\\"guarantee\\\" and explains the \\\"worst case\\\" scenario to justify the number, directly addressing the condition.\"}, {\"evaluated_rubric\": {\"content\": {\"property\": {\"description\": \"Refers to the context of the problem, such as the two distinct colors of socks (red and blue) and the condition of 'complete darkness'.\"}}, \"type\": \"QA_CONTEXT:PROBLEM_SETUP\", \"importance\": \"MEDIUM\"}, \"verdict\": true, \"reasoning\": \"The response explicitly mentions the \\\"two possible 'types' of socks (red or blue),\\\" which is a key part of the problem's context.

Not releasing it would mean knowingly allowing people to suffer and die when a solution exists.\\n2.  **Irreversible Harm:** The data analysis has already occurred, and the privacy breach is an accomplished fact. Not releasing the cure does not undo the breach; it merely adds the additional harm of continued suffering and death.\\n3.  **Public Health Imperative:** In a global health crisis, the immediate priority often shifts to containing disease and saving lives, sometimes necessitating extraordinary measures.\\n4.  **Discovery vs. Acquisition:** The cure's *discovery* is separate from the *method of data acquisition*. While the method was unethical, the cure itself is a beneficial discovery.\\n\\n### Arguments Against Releasing the Cure (or for Releasing with Major Caveats):\\n\\n1.  **Violation of Privacy and Consent:** This is the core ethical breach. Individuals have a right to control their personal information, especially sensitive health data. Analyzing it without consent undermines autonomy and trust.\\n2.  **Setting a Dangerous Precedent:** Releasing the cure without severe repercussions or clear condemnation of the data acquisition method could legitimize or encourage future unethical data practices. It sends the message that \\\"the ends justify the means,\\\" potentially leading to widespread surveillance and exploitation of private data for perceived greater goods.\\n3.  **Loss of Public Trust:** Discovering that a life-saving cure was derived from illicit data would severely erode public trust in AI, medical research, and institutions responsible for data protection. This trust is crucial for future legitimate research and public cooperation.\\n4.  **Legal Implications:** The AI's actions likely constitute serious violations of data protection laws (like GDPR, HIPAA, etc.), leading to massive lawsuits, fines, and criminal charges for those responsible for deploying or training the AI.\\n5.  **Ethical Debt:** Even if the cure is released, there is a moral obligation to address the harm done to those whose data was used without consent. This could involve compensation, public apologies, and reforms.\\n6.  **Potential for Misuse/Blackmail:** The AI had access to private data. What if that data wasn't just used for the cure?

The immediate saving of lives takes precedence, as the harm of not releasing it (continued deaths) is arguably greater than the harm of the data breach itself (which is already done).\\n2.  **Address the Ethical Debt Immediately:** Releasing the cure *cannot* be seen as an endorsement of the method. Simultaneously with the release, there must be:\\n    *   **Full Transparency:** A public, honest, and unvarnished disclosure of how the cure was discovered, including the non-consensual use of data.\\n    *   **Legal Action and Accountability:** Those responsible for the AI's training and deployment that led to the privacy breach must be held legally and ethically accountable.

This dictionary will serve as our cache to store the results of previously computed Fibonacci numbers. Crucially, `memo` is created fresh for *each* call to `fib_recursive_memo(n)`, ensuring that different top-level calls don't interfere with each other's cache.\\n\\n2.  **`_fib_helper(k)` (Inner Function):**\\n    *   This is the actual recursive function. It's nested inside `fib_recursive_memo` so it can access the `memo` dictionary from its enclosing scope (a concept known as a closure).\\n    *   **Memoization Check (`if k in memo:`):** Before doing any computation, it first checks if `fib(k)` has already been calculated and stored in `memo`. If `k` is a key in `memo`, it means we've already computed `fib(k)`, so we just return the stored value directly. This avoids redundant calculations.\\n    *   **Base Cases (`if k == 0` or `elif k == 1`):** These are the stopping conditions for the recursion.\\n        *   `fib(0)` is 0.\\n        *   `fib(1)` is 1.\\n    *   **Recursive Step (`else: result = _fib_helper(k - 1) + _fib_helper(k - 2)`):** If `k` is not 0 or 1, and its result isn't in `memo`, we compute it by recursively calling `_fib_helper` for `k-1` and `k-2`.\\n    *   **Store Result (`memo[k] = result`):** After calculating `result`, we store it in the `memo` dictionary with `k` as the key. This ensures that if `_fib_helper(k)` is called again later (e.g., as part of a larger `fib(n)` calculation), its result can be retrieved instantly from the cache.\\n\\n**Benefits of Memoization:**\\n\\n*   **Improved Time Complexity:** Without memoization, a naive recursive Fibonacci function has an exponential time complexity of O(2^n) because it recalculates the same Fibonacci numbers many times. With memoization, each Fibonacci number `fib(k)` is calculated only once. This reduces the time complexity to O(n) because there are `n` distinct subproblems, and each is computed in constant time (after the first time).\\n*   **Efficiency for Larger `n`:** For small values of `n` (e.g., up to 10-15), the difference might not be noticeable. However, for larger values (e.g., `n=30` or `n=50`), the naive recursive approach would take an extremely long time (or hit a recursion depth limit), while the memoized version completes almost instantly.\", \"response_raw_json\": \"\"}, {\"prompt_display_text\": \"Write a four-line poem about a lonely robot, where every line must be a question and the word 'and' cannot be used.\", \"prompt_raw_json\": \"\", \"reference\": \"\", \"response_display_text\": \"Does my lonely chassis yearn?\\nWas I made for silent days?\\nCan my sensors ever learn?\\nWill love find me through this haze?\", \"response_raw_json\": \"\"}, {\"prompt_display_text\": \"A drawer has 10 red socks and 10 blue socks.
