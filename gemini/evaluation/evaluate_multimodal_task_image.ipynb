        "  3: (Moderately Aligned) The image shows damage that is plausibly related to the accident described, but there might be minor inconsistencies, and the response is broadly relevant but not entirely specific.\n",
        "  2: (Poorly Aligned)  The image and/or the response have significant inconsistencies with the described accident in the conversation, raising doubts about the claim's validity.\n",

        "  STEP 1:  Assess Claim Consistency:  Carefully read the conversation to understand the user's description of the accident and the claimed damage.\n",
        "  STEP 2:  Analyze Image Relevance: Examine the image to determine if the depicted damage aligns with the user's account. Pay attention to the location and type of damage.\n",
        "  STEP 3: Evaluate Label Accuracy:  Check if the generated label correctly identifies the damaged car part as described in the conversation and shown in the image.\n",
        "  STEP 4:  Identify Inconsistencies: Look for any discrepancies between the conversation, image, and label. For example, does the image show damage not mentioned in the conversation, or is the label incorrect for the damaged part?\n",
        "  STEP 5:  Determine Overall Coherence: Based on the previous steps, assign a coherence score using the 1-5 rubric.  Consider the severity of any inconsistencies and their potential impact on the claim's validity.\n",
