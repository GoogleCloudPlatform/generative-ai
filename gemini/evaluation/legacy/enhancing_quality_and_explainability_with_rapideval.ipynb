It is part of the [Vertex AI Evaluation Service](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/determine-eval), which also allows you to evaluate models and prompts in an offline fashion.\n",
        "\n",
        "Rapid Evaluation is primarily used ad-hoc in the initial experimental phase for evaluating which set of prompts and models work well for a use case. However, as described in detail in the corresponding blog, this notebook will show some sample code on dummy data of how you can use Rapid Evaluation to enhance the quality of the response generated by the LLMs by combining the pairwise and pointwise capabilities of Rapid Evaluation elegantly at the time of generation. It would also then return a human readable explanation to help understand the quality evaluation of the response. Note that although this notebook only demonstrates this workflow on text, it can be extended to any modality once an evaluation mechanism is available for that modality.\n",
