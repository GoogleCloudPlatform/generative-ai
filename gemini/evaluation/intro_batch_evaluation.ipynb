    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Different from getting online (synchronous) responses, where you are limited to one input request at a time, the batch evaluations in Vertex AI allow you to send a large number of evaluation requests to a Gemini model in a single batch request. Then, the model responses asynchronously populate to your storage output location in [Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/introduction).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, you learn how to run batch evaluation with the Gemini API in Vertex AI. This tutorial shows how to use **Cloud Storage** as input sources. Vertex AI Gen AI Eval service supports **BigQuery** as well. Refer to the [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/run-evaluation#batch-eval) to learn more.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will complete the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Preparing batch inputs and an output location\n",
    "- Submitting a batch evaluation long running operation\n",
    "- Retrieving batch evaluation results\n"
