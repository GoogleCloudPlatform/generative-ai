        "\n",
        "This Colab shows how to assess the grounding capabilities of generative models, evaluating their ability to generate responses that are factually consistent with and derived from a given textual context. Assessing grounding with custom parsing, as shown here, offers a more advanced evaluation compared to the standard [metric prompt templates](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/metrics-templates), allowing for detailed analysis of factual consistency and source relevance.\n",
        "\n",
        "It goes beyond basic information retrieval by examining the extent to which model outputs are truly rooted in the provided source and can synthesize information accurately from that context. The approach to grounding demonstrated here is based on the [FACTS Grounding Benchmark](https://www.kaggle.com/facts-leaderboard/examples).\n",
        "\n",
        "This is accomplished using the Vertex Gen AI Evaluation SDK which supports custom output parsing. The prompt instructs the autorater model to return a structured (JSON) output which is then parsed seemlessly by providing the parsing method in the metric definition. The parsed output is appended to the evaluation result data frame.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Objective\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Generate structured output from an autorater.\n",
        "2. Use custom parsing for advanced evalutation.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Set up the environment.\n",
        "2. Define helper functions, prompt templates, and metric.\n",
        "3. Prepare the dataset for evaluation.\n",
