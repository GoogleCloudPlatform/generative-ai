        "\n",
        "This CoLAB shows how to leverage the Vertex AI evaluation service in order to run [Gecko](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16820).\n",
        "\n",
        "As with a more standard rubric approach, Gecko proceeds in two stages: a rubric generation step followed by a validator step. The key difference is that the rubric is generated based on the prompt.\n",
        "This allows for a more fine-grained metric that can be customized to prompts with differing challenges.\n",
        "\n",
        "In more detail, Gecko proceeds as follows, with two key steps: the QA generation step (ie the rubric generation step) and then the VQA step (ie the validator step).\n",
        "\n",
        "## The rubric generation step\n",
        "Given a prompt, such as `A teddy bear riding a skateboard`, we prompt the Gemini model to generate a set of questions, answer choices and corresponding ground truth (GT) answer. The question is also tagged with a question type. Depending on the prompt, these questions can either be `yes`/`no` questions or multiple choice ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "`A teddy bear riding a skateboard` -->\n",
        "\n",
        "- `Q1: Is there a teddy bear? Choices: [yes, no]. GT Answer: yes. Tag: Object.`\n",
        "- `Q2: Is there a skateboard? Choices: [yes, no]. GT Answer: yes. Tag: Object.`\n",
        "- `Q3: Is the teddy bear riding a skateboard? Choices: [yes, no]. GT Answer: yes. Tag: Action.`\n",
        "\n",
        "## The validator step\n",
        "Given a generated image and the questions above, we query the Gemini model for each question to give an answer. We then check if it matches the GT answer, with a result of 1 if it matches and 0 if it does not. We aggregate these results to give a final overall score, which can be broken down into scores per question. We can also aggregate scores based on tags.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, imagine we have a generated image `<image1>` which includes a teddy bear but no skateboard, and Gemini outputs the following results:\n",
        "\n",
        "- `<image1> Is there a teddy bear? GT Answer: yes. Result: 1.`\n",
        "- `<image1> Is there a skateboard? GT Answer: no. Result: 0.`\n",
        "- `<image1> Is the teddy bear riding a skateboard? GT Answer: no. Result: 0.`\n",
        "\n",
        "The final score will be `0.33` with a score of `0.5` for the question tag and `0.0` for the action tag.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Further exploration\n",
        "We provide two prompts, engineered for video and image generation tasks. Below, we show how to run Gecko for the video modality on a set of generations.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, these prompts can be modified and changed as suits a developer's needs. The quality can be analysed by exploring what  questions are generated as well as the reliability of the validator step. Questions can also be manually added as desired for an application.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Set up the environment.\n",
        "2. Define helper functions, prompt templates, and metric.\n",
        "3. Prepare the dataset for evaluation.\n",
        "4. Run the evaluation (including model inference).\n",
