    "\n",
    "**📦 Session**\n",
    "\n",
    "In Google ADK, A session is a foundational element of Context Engineering. A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a single, continuous conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A session is tied to a user and for a specific agent. For instance a session history for 1 user is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agent. These segregation helps to keep information separate and private(limited) thus enabling the Agent's performance over time. \n",
    "\n",
    "**📝 Events**:\n",
    "\n",
    "While A session is a container for conversations, Events are the building blocks of a conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User Input**: A message from the user (text, audio, image, etc.)\n",
    "- **Agent Response**: The agent's reply to the user\n",
    "- **Tool Call**: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API\n",
    "- **Tool Output**: The data returned from a tool call, which the agent uses to continue its reasoning"
