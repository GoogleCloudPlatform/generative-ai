    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will explore Vertex AI Embeddings API for both Text and Multimodal (Images and Video). Before we jump right into it, let's understand what are embeddings?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Embeddings: Translating Content into the Language of Numbers**\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're trying to describe a friend's personality to someone else. You could use words like \"kind,\" \"energetic,\" or \"thoughtful.\" But wouldn't it be cool if you could assign a set of numbers to each of these qualities to create a unique code for your friend?\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings do something similar for various types of content:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **For text:** Each word, sentence, or even an entire document gets transformed into a list of numbers (a vector). These numbers capture the meaning and relationships between words. For example, the word \"cat\" might be represented as [0.25, -0.18, 0.93...], while \"kitten\" could be [0.30, -0.16, 0.88...]. The close proximity of these vectors indicates a semantic connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **For images:** Instead of pixels, an image becomes a vector that represents the visual features in the image. A picture of a sunny beach might get translated into [0.85, 0.42, -0.05...], while a snowy mountain might be [-0.32, 0.78, 0.12...].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **For video:** Each frame or even the entire video sequence gets a numerical representation that encapsulates the visual content, movement, and potentially even audio information.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take another example: Imagine you have a giant box of mismatched items: books, photographs, movie DVDs, and more. Each item is unique and complex, but you want to organize them in a way that makes sense. Embeddings do this, but for data like text, images, and videos.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, embeddings are like secret codes that represent your data in a simplified way. Think of them as numerical coordinates on a map. Similar items (like books on the same topic or photos of the same place) will be close to each other on this map, while very different items will be far apart.\n"

    "**Why Do We Need Embeddings?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers are great at crunching numbers, but they struggle to understand raw text, images, or videos. Embeddings act like a translator, converting these complex things into a format computers can easily work with. This opens up a world of possibilities for tasks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Finding Similarities:** By comparing the numbers in these vectors, you can easily determine how similar or different pieces of content are. Think of it as a way to measure the \"distance\" between meanings. This allows you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Find documents with related topics\n",
    "    - Discover visually similar images\n",
    "    - Group videos with similar content\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Searching and Recommending:** Imagine you're looking for a specific image, but you don't have the right keywords to search for it. With embeddings, you can simply provide an example image, and the search engine can find other images that are similar in visual style or content.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Machine Learning and AI:** Embeddings are the backbone of many modern AI applications. They are used to train models that can understand and generate text, classify images, translate languages, and even create art."
