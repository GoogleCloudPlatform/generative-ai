    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this hands-on workshop where we explore the cutting-edge field of multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). In this session, we'll focus on utilizing both textual and visual data to perform complex question answering (Q&A) over CVS and Medicare documents. This approach not only enriches the interaction with the data but also enhances the decision-making process by leveraging a broader spectrum of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation has revolutionized the way Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with information by enabling them to access external data. This not only enriches their knowledge base but also grounds their responses, significantly reducing the likelihood of generating inaccurate information, commonly referred to as \"hallucinations.\"\n",

    "## Understanding Gemini: A Multimodal AI by DeepMind\n",
    "\n",
    "Gemini is a suite of generative AI models developed by Google DeepMind tailored for multimodal applications. With Gemini, you can process and analyze data that includes text, images, audio, and even videos. The API provides seamless access to various versions of the Gemini models, each designed for specific capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Gemini 1.0 Pro Vision: Supports multimodal prompts. You can include text, images, and video in your prompt requests and get text or code responses.\n",
    "    Gemini 1.0 Pro: Designed to handle natural language tasks, multiturn text and code chat, and code generation.\n",
    "    Gemini 1.5 Pro: Created to be multimodal (text, images, audio, PDFs, code, videos) and to scale across a wide range of tasks with up to 1M input tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advantages of Multimodal RAG over Text-Based RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "Multimodal RAG extends the capabilities of text-only RAG by integrating visual processing, which offers several advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Enhanced Knowledge Access: By analyzing both text and visual content, the model taps into a richer knowledge base, providing more comprehensive insights.\n",
    "    Improved Reasoning Capabilities: Visual cues enable the model to make more informed inferences, improving accuracy and relevance in responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives and Learning Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, you will learn to build a robust document search engine using multimodal RAG. Here are the key steps we will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Document Processing: Extract and store metadata from documents containing text and images.\n",
    "    Embedding Generation: Produce text and multimodal embeddings to facilitate efficient search capabilities.\n",
    "    Metadata Searching:\n",
    "        Use text queries to locate similar text or images within the document metadata.\n",
    "        Use image queries to find related images.\n",
    "        Employ text queries to search for contextual answers using both text and image data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hands-on Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this workshop, you'll engage in practical exercises that illustrate how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Construct a Multimedia Metadata Repository: This repository will serve as the backbone of your document search engine, enabling sophisticated search, comparison, and reasoning across various types of data.\n",
    "    Use Gemini API for Multimodal Queries: Learn how to send mixed media prompts to Gemini models and interpret the outputs effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this workshop, you'll have a foundational understanding of how to implement and utilize multimodal RAG for enhanced data interaction and retrieval. This knowledge will empower you to handle more complex data sets and contribute to advancements in the field of generative AI."
