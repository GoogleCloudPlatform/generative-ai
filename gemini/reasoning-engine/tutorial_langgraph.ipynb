[LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs, used to create agent and multi-agent workflows.\n",

        "This notebook demonstrates how to build, deploy, and test a simple LangGraph application using [Reasoning Engine](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/reasoning-engine/overview) in Vertex AI. You'll learn how to combine LangGraph's workflow orchestration with the scalability of Vertex AI, which enables you to build custom generative AI applications.\n",

        "Note that the approach used in this notebook defines a [custom application template in Reasoning Engine](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/reasoning-engine/customize), which can be extended to LangChain or other orchestration frameworks. If just want to use LangChain on Vertex AI to build agentic generative AI applications, refer to the documentation for [developing with the LangChain template in Reasoning Engine](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/reasoning-engine/develop).\n",

        "- **Build a LangGraph Application**: Structure your application using LangGraph, including the Gemini model and custom tools that you define.\n",
        "- **Local Testing**: Test your LangGraph application locally to ensure functionality.\n",
        "- **Deploying to Vertex AI**: Seamlessly deploy your LangGraph application to Reasoning Engine for scalable execution.\n",
        "- **Remote Testing**: Interact with your deployed application through Vertex AI, testing its functionality in a production-like environment.\n",
