        "LlamaIndex workflows are a powerful way to orchestrate complex LLM (large language model) applications. They provide an event-driven framework for building AI systems that go beyond simple question-answering.   \n",
        "\n",
        "Think of a workflow as a series of steps, where each step performs a specific action. These actions can be anything from querying an LLM, to retrieving data from a vector database, to interacting with external APIs. The workflow manages the flow of data between these steps, making it easy to build sophisticated AI applications.   \n",
        "\n",
        "Here's a breakdown of the key concepts:\n",
        "\n",
        "+ Events: These trigger actions within the workflow. For example, a user's query can be an initial event that kicks off the workflow.   \n",
        "+ Steps: These are individual functions decorated with @step that process events and potentially emit new events. Steps are the building blocks of your workflow.   \n",
        "+ Event-driven: This means that the workflow reacts to events as they happen, making it flexible and dynamic."

              "**Unrequited Love:** The green light's physical proximity to Gatsby, yet separation by the bay, mirrors the emotional distance between him and Daisy. He yearns for her, but she remains out of reach, symbolizing his unrequited love.\n",
              "\n",

However, this hope is ultimately an illusion, as Daisy has moved on and their circumstances have changed.\n",
              "\n",
              "**The American Dream:** The green light can be interpreted as a symbol of the American Dream, representing Gatsby's relentless pursuit of wealth and social status. He believes that achieving these goals will bring him happiness and allow him to win Daisy's love. However, the novel ultimately suggests that the American Dream is often unattainable and can lead to disillusionment.\n",
