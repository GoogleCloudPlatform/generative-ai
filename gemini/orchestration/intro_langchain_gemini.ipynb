        "1. **Integration** - Bring external data, such as your files, other applications, and API data, to LLMs\n",

This makes models data-aware and agentic, meaning they can understand, reason, and use data to take action in a meaningful way. The external systems could be public data corpus, private knowledge repositories, databases, applications, APIs, or access to the public internet via Google Search.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. **Agents** enable language models to communicate with its environment, where the model then decides the next action to take. LangChain provides out of the box support for using and customizing 'chains' - a series of actions strung together.\n",

        "Though LLMs can be straightforward (text-in, text-out) you'll quickly run into friction points that LangChain helps with once you develop more complicated applications.\n",
