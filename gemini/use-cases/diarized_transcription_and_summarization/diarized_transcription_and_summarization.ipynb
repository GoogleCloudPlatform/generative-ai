        "\n",
        "Many businesses, particularly in the financial sector( but also other industries), struggle with accurately transcribing and summarizing multilingual audio recordings which could be several hours long. This challenge is especially critical for use cases that directly impact customer experience and financial outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some key obstacles include:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Hallucinations**: AI models sometimes generate incorrect or nonsensical information.\n",
        "- **Numerical Inaccuracies**: Precise transcription of numbers is crucial in finance, and errors can have serious consequences.\n",
        "- **Speaker Misidentification for multilingual conversations**: Accurately attributing dialogue in multi-speaker settings, especially with more than two participants in multilingual settings, can be complex.\n",
        "- **Summarization Deficiencies**: Generating concise summaries tailored to the specific financial domain is essential for efficient analysis.\n",
        "- **Recordings which are several hours long**: Ensuring diariiyation and transcription can be both effectively and efficiently performed on long recordings.\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates sample code for a semi-agentic, multimodal [solution developed for Commerzbank](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/how-commerzbank-is-transforming-financial-advisory-workflows-with-gen-ai).  A more advanced version of this solution is currently deployed in production, delivering substantial productivity gains.\n",

        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, you will learn how to do build an advanced diarized transcription and domain/task specific summarization using the multimodal capabilities of Gemini on Vertex AI together with the Gen AI Evaluation Service API in Vertex AI service for Python.\n",
        "You will complete the following tasks:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Install the Vertex AI SDK for Python\n",
        "- Chunk an audio file into segments of pre specified durations\n",
        "- Use the Gemini on Vertex AI to interact with the audio files\n",
        "  - Gemini 1.5 Pro (`gemini-1.5-pro`) model:\n",
        "    - to use few-shot multimodal prompting combined with specific task specific instructions to perform sequential diarized transcription of  all the contiguous audio chunks, using the output generated at each step as input for the next one\n",
        "    - extract task/domain specific facts and figures \n",
        "    - generate multiple task specific summaries from the extracted facts and diarized transcript\n",
        "    - select the best summary for each task, using pointwise and pairwise evaluations using the Gen AI Evaluation Service."
