    "Small-to-big retrieval is a form of [modular recursive RAG](https://www.promptingguide.ai/research/rag#modular-rag), where you link smaller grounding data chunks to larger \"parent\" data chunks. When a small chunk is retrieved at runtime, the larger linked chunk can be retrieved if needed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The Small-to-big strategy offers a few benefits over regular RAG: \n",
    "1. **Complex use cases**: Small-to-big RAG can be used to handle complex queries where the context is too large to fit into a single dense vector. Examples: legal documents, research papers. \n",
    "2. **Work around the limits of dense vectors**: Dense vectors can only \"squish\" the meaning of a text so much. If you try to embed a chunk that's too long (eg. an entire document), some of the meaning may be lost, resulting in less accurate retrieval results. By keeping the small vector chunks small, and retrieving large documents later (with or without embeddings), you're getting the semantic-search benefits of dense vectors, while still being able to retrieve the full context when needed.\n",
    "3. **Cost**: You can set up small-to-big RAG to only fetch the long documents when needed (eg. if the model is unable to respond with the small context). This can save on inference costs, because Gemini on Vertex AI is [priced per input character](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/pricing). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are multiple ways to implement small-to-big RAG. The small chunks could represent short passages of a document, and the larger chunks could represent the entire surrounding context (eg. the whole document) - see LangChain's [ParentDocumentRetriever](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/data_connection/retrievers/parent_document_retriever) for more info. Another way is to have the small chunks represent summaries of the larger documents. That is the method we'll explore here. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll walk through a Small-to-big RAG example using a GitHub codebase called [Online Boutique](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/microservices-demo). Online Boutique is a microservices, multi-language sample application. We'll implement a question answering functionality to help a new contributor learn about and navigate this codebase."
