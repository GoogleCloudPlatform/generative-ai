For optimal results in a large-scale solution, splitting the processing into two steps (i.e., requests) should help Gemini's attention focus even further. In the first step, we'd extract and diarize the audio stream only, which should result in the most precise speech-to-text transcription (maybe with more voice identifiers than actual speakers, but with a minimal number of false positives). In the second step, we'd reinject the transcription to focus on extracting and consolidating speaker data from the video frames.

In contrast, Gemini proved to be a versatile toolbox for reaching a powerful and straightforward solution based on a single prompt:\n",

        "\n",
        "We managed to address this complex problem with the following techniques:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Prototyping with open prompts to develop intuition about Gemini's natural strengths\n",
        "- Taking into account how LLMs work under the hood\n",
        "- Crafting increasingly specific prompts using a tabular extraction strategy\n",
        "- Generating structured outputs to move towards production-ready code\n",
        "- Adding data visualization for easier interpretation of responses and smoother iterations\n",
        "- Adapting default parameters to optimize the results\n",
        "- Conducting more tests, iterating, and even enriching the extracted data\n",

        "These principles should apply to many other data extraction domains and allow you to solve your own complex problems. Have fun and happy solving!\n"
