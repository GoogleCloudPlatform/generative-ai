For optimal results in a large-scale solution, splitting the processing into two steps (i.e., requests) should help Gemini's attention focus even further. In the first step, we'd extract and diarize the audio stream only, which should result in the most precise speech-to-text transcription (maybe with more voice identifiers than actual speakers, but with a minimal number of false positives). In the second step, we'd reinject the transcription to focus on extracting and consolidating speaker data from the video frames. This would also be a solution to process very long videos, even those several hours in duration.\n"
