Automating remediations or fitting the findings into a review workflow would exist in a more mature tool, and hasn't been considered as part of the experiment. While Gemini 1.5 Pro demonstrates promising capabilities in code analysis, it's important to note that this approach is still experimental. We believe that it is important to explore the potential of this technology for vulnerability detection, and continue development and validation efforts before it can be considered a robust security tool"
