He began writing in 1854 with a short story called \\\"Master Zacharias, or the Clockmaker's Soul\\\". It was the first time he talked of the negative side of progress - the evil that results from some discoveries or inventions when they fall into the wrong hands. This becomes a running theme in his novels: Captain Nemo in TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA, or Robur (from ROBUR THE CONQUEROR and it's sequel, THE MASTER OF THE WORLD) are two of his best examples of this them. Kongre, in THE LIGHTHOUSE AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD, is another.Verne was so prolific that when he died in 1905 he left a dozen unpublished novels and stories that were not fully published until 1910. They include some of his best writing, such as THE BARSAC MISSION (partly written by Verne's son Michael), THE SURVIVORS OF THE \\\"JONATHAN\\\", THE PURSUIT OF THE METEOR, THE DANUBE PILOT. All of these dealt with science, but also dealt with political systems, and economics, for Verne was interested in all the problems facing modern man. THE LIGHTHOUSE AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD was the last novel that was published in Verne's lifetime. It does not deal with the political questions or economic ones that perplexed him, but seems to go back to his potboiler period, when he was turning out stories for money while considering better stories for later publication. But nothing Verne wrote is without interest. Rereading THE LIGHTHOUSE one sees what the subtle point is in it. It is the study of how the ego of a villain can prevent him from escaping retribution.Kongre (renamed Jonathan Kongre) is one of the last pirates in the world of 1900. He and his gang find a damaged boat and repair it. They sail it across the Pacific, and reach Staten Island, a small island in the Straits of Magellan controlled by Chile. There they find a lighthouse with a crew of three men. They manage to kill two of them, but the third one (named Vasquez - he's from Chile, remember), hides on the island. Kongre and his men decide that they should prepare to leave the island shortly, before the Chilean Naval relief boat returns in three months to pick up the lighthouse crew. But first they will wreck any boat that comes to the passage, and increase their ill-gotten gains. But the key to the novel (and it is not in the movie) is that Kongre's right hand men (Carcante and Vargas) keep urging him to pack up his supplies and wealth and head to Asia where the money can be divvied up and everyone separate in safety. And each time Kongre won't do it. Initially it is pure greed. He wrecks a boat, and massacres the crew (a scene that is done in the film). The sole survivor is an American, John Davis (the name became Denton in the film, except that it was given to the character of Vasquez). Now with an ally (and not a drunken one, as in the film), Vasquez starts sabotaging Kongre's activities on the island. Carcante keeps suggesting leaving, but Kongre (unused to someone annoying him successfully) keeps delaying in order to catch Vasquez and Davis. The end result is that when he thinks he has them cornered, the Chilean boat appears to sink his craft, kill most of his crew, and confront him. Kongre commits suicide to avoid capture.Much of the mayhem of the movie (with Denton picking off crew members one at a time) is not in the book. Nor is there any female character in the novel (a rarity in most of Verne's stories - he could be quite a feminist when he wished). The egotism of \\\"Jonathan\\\" Kongre is well shown by Yul Brynner's performance, but the subtlety of that trait is lost. The writers presumably did not think the audience could appreciate it. Kirk Douglas does well enough as Denton, but his singlehanded success (Vasquez and Davis work together well to the end of the story, unlike Denton's ally who is killed by the pirates) seems unlikely. The bestiality of the pirates is well shown in the movie, particularly a singularly tall actor who in one scene wears women's clothing to particularly unsettling effect. The film is not a bad minor adventure film, but it could have been better if they had stuck to Verne's theme.\",\n          \"Remove yourself from the Kirk Douglass aspects of the casting. It is essential to your enjoying the film. There is a beautiful young woman playing double roles - and in the photos from the 1800's, I can't believe how smooth and white her skin is. Also, there is an excellent degrading of the film stock which chills the mind if you like faded greys and yellows as I do. This film is played on TNT from time to time so see it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"keywords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Here are the keywords extracted from the text:\\n\\n*   Brynner\\n*   Douglas\\n*   Slow pace\\n*   Violence\\n*   Gore\\n*   Seventies\\n*   Giallo\\n*   Action flick\\n*   Hero flick\\n*   Novel comparison\\n*   Rocky island\\n*   Jules Verne\\n*   Adventure\\n*   Sci-fi\\n*   Subs\",\n          \"Here are the keywords extracted from the text:\\n\\n*   **Jules Verne**\\n*   **The Lighthouse at the Edge of the World**\\n*   **Kongre** (Jonathan Kongre)\\n*   **Negative side of progress**\\n*   **Villain's ego**\\n*   **Retribution**\\n*   **Master Zacharias, or the Clockmaker's Soul**\\n*   **Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea**\\n*   **Captain Nemo**\\n*   **Robur the Conqueror**\\n*   **The Master of the World**\\n*   **Unpublished novels**\\n*   **Posthumous publications**\\n*   **Science** (theme)\\n*   **Political systems** (theme)\\n*   **Economics** (theme)\\n*   **Pirates**\\n*   **Vasquez**\\n*   **John Davis** (Denton)\\n*   **Film adaptation**\\n*   **Yul Brynner**\\n*   **Kirk Douglas**\\n*   **Staten Island**\\n*   **Straits of Magellan**\",\n          \"Here are the keywords extracted from the text:\\n\\n*   Film Recommendation\\n*   Casting\\n*   Kirk Douglass (reference)\\n*   Double Roles\\n*   Actress\\n*   1800s Photos\\n*   Skin Appearance\\n*   Film Stock Degradation\\n*   Visuals\\n*   Faded Greys and Yellows (Color Palette)\\n*   TNT (Channel)\\n*   Film Availability\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

He began writing in 1854 with a short story called \\\"Master Zacharias, or the Clockmaker's Soul\\\". It was the first time he talked of the negative side of progress - the evil that results from some discoveries or inventions when they fall into the wrong hands. This becomes a running theme in his novels: Captain Nemo in TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA, or Robur (from ROBUR THE CONQUEROR and it's sequel, THE MASTER OF THE WORLD) are two of his best examples of this them. Kongre, in THE LIGHTHOUSE AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD, is another.Verne was so prolific that when he died in 1905 he left a dozen unpublished novels and stories that were not fully published until 1910. They include some of his best writing, such as THE BARSAC MISSION (partly written by Verne's son Michael), THE SURVIVORS OF THE \\\"JONATHAN\\\", THE PURSUIT OF THE METEOR, THE DANUBE PILOT. All of these dealt with science, but also dealt with political systems, and economics, for Verne was interested in all the problems facing modern man. THE LIGHTHOUSE AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD was the last novel that was published in Verne's lifetime. It does not deal with the political questions or economic ones that perplexed him, but seems to go back to his potboiler period, when he was turning out stories for money while considering better stories for later publication. But nothing Verne wrote is without interest. Rereading THE LIGHTHOUSE one sees what the subtle point is in it. It is the study of how the ego of a villain can prevent him from escaping retribution.Kongre (renamed Jonathan Kongre) is one of the last pirates in the world of 1900. He and his gang find a damaged boat and repair it. They sail it across the Pacific, and reach Staten Island, a small island in the Straits of Magellan controlled by Chile. There they find a lighthouse with a crew of three men. They manage to kill two of them, but the third one (named Vasquez - he's from Chile, remember), hides on the island. Kongre and his men decide that they should prepare to leave the island shortly, before the Chilean Naval relief boat returns in three months to pick up the lighthouse crew. But first they will wreck any boat that comes to the passage, and increase their ill-gotten gains. But the key to the novel (and it is not in the movie) is that Kongre's right hand men (Carcante and Vargas) keep urging him to pack up his supplies and wealth and head to Asia where the money can be divvied up and everyone separate in safety. And each time Kongre won't do it. Initially it is pure greed. He wrecks a boat, and massacres the crew (a scene that is done in the film). The sole survivor is an American, John Davis (the name became Denton in the film, except that it was given to the character of Vasquez). Now with an ally (and not a drunken one, as in the film), Vasquez starts sabotaging Kongre's activities on the island. Carcante keeps suggesting leaving, but Kongre (unused to someone annoying him successfully) keeps delaying in order to catch Vasquez and Davis. The end result is that when he thinks he has them cornered, the Chilean boat appears to sink his craft, kill most of his crew, and confront him. Kongre commits suicide to avoid capture.Much of the mayhem of the movie (with Denton picking off crew members one at a time) is not in the book. Nor is there any female character in the novel (a rarity in most of Verne's stories - he could be quite a feminist when he wished). The egotism of \\\"Jonathan\\\" Kongre is well shown by Yul Brynner's performance, but the subtlety of that trait is lost. The writers presumably did not think the audience could appreciate it. Kirk Douglas does well enough as Denton, but his singlehanded success (Vasquez and Davis work together well to the end of the story, unlike Denton's ally who is killed by the pirates) seems unlikely. The bestiality of the pirates is well shown in the movie, particularly a singularly tall actor who in one scene wears women's clothing to particularly unsettling effect. The film is not a bad minor adventure film, but it could have been better if they had stuck to Verne's theme.\",\n          \"Remove yourself from the Kirk Douglass aspects of the casting. It is essential to your enjoying the film. There is a beautiful young woman playing double roles - and in the photos from the 1800's, I can't believe how smooth and white her skin is. Also, there is an excellent degrading of the film stock which chills the mind if you like faded greys and yellows as I do. This film is played on TNT from time to time so see it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"keywords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Here are the keywords from the text:\\n\\n*   Jules Verne\\n*   Hollywood\\n*   Movie review\\n*   Yul Brynner\\n*   Douglass\\n*   \",\n          \"Here are the keywords from the text:\\n\\n*   Film\\n*   Casting\\n*   Kirk Douglas\\n*   Double roles\\n*   1800s photos\\n*   Film stock degrading\\n*   Faded greys and yellows\\n*   TNT\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Even more surprising that Hollywood would produce it. Yul Brynner is unbelievably good as a man freed of all bounds of convention, free to indulge his taste for cruelty and domination. Douglass is an excellent counterpoint, a courageous individual who's chosen simple solitude as a way to deal with the complications and turmoil society had imposed on him. And Samantha Egger's character is the capper, a woman willing to sacrifice far too much for comfort and safety. Inotherwords, everyman. The movie does show its age and is limited by the conventions of time and place and technology of the time. If you're looking for special effects and action as substitutes for thought, look elsewhere.\",\n          \"Jules Verne wrote about 80 novels as well as plays and short stories in his career. He began writing in 1854 with a short story called \\\"Master Zacharias, or the Clockmaker's Soul\\\". It was the first time he talked of the negative side of progress - the evil that results from some discoveries or inventions when they fall into the wrong hands. This becomes a running theme in his novels: Captain Nemo in TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA, or Robur (from ROBUR THE CONQUEROR and it's sequel, THE MASTER OF THE WORLD) are two of his best examples of this them. Kongre, in THE LIGHTHOUSE AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD, is another.Verne was so prolific that when he died in 1905 he left a dozen unpublished novels and stories that were not fully published until 1910. They include some of his best writing, such as THE BARSAC MISSION (partly written by Verne's son Michael), THE SURVIVORS OF THE \\\"JONATHAN\\\", THE PURSUIT OF THE METEOR, THE DANUBE PILOT. All of these dealt with science, but also dealt with political systems, and economics, for Verne was interested in all the problems facing modern man. THE LIGHTHOUSE AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD was the last novel that was published in Verne's lifetime. It does not deal with the political questions or economic ones that perplexed him, but seems to go back to his potboiler period, when he was turning out stories for money while considering better stories for later publication. But nothing Verne wrote is without interest. Rereading THE LIGHTHOUSE one sees what the subtle point is in it. It is the study of how the ego of a villain can prevent him from escaping retribution.Kongre (renamed Jonathan Kongre) is one of the last pirates in the world of 1900. He and his gang find a damaged boat and repair it. They sail it across the Pacific, and reach Staten Island, a small island in the Straits of Magellan controlled by Chile. There they find a lighthouse with a crew of three men. They manage to kill two of them, but the third one (named Vasquez - he's from Chile, remember), hides on the island. Kongre and his men decide that they should prepare to leave the island shortly, before the Chilean Naval relief boat returns in three months to pick up the lighthouse crew. But first they will wreck any boat that comes to the passage, and increase their ill-gotten gains. But the key to the novel (and it is not in the movie) is that Kongre's right hand men (Carcante and Vargas) keep urging him to pack up his supplies and wealth and head to Asia where the money can be divvied up and everyone separate in safety. And each time Kongre won't do it. Initially it is pure greed. He wrecks a boat, and massacres the crew (a scene that is done in the film). The sole survivor is an American, John Davis (the name became Denton in the film, except that it was given to the character of Vasquez). Now with an ally (and not a drunken one, as in the film), Vasquez starts sabotaging Kongre's activities on the island. Carcante keeps suggesting leaving, but Kongre (unused to someone annoying him successfully) keeps delaying in order to catch Vasquez and Davis. The end result is that when he thinks he has them cornered, the Chilean boat appears to sink his craft, kill most of his crew, and confront him. Kongre commits suicide to avoid capture.Much of the mayhem of the movie (with Denton picking off crew members one at a time) is not in the book. Nor is there any female character in the novel (a rarity in most of Verne's stories - he could be quite a feminist when he wished). The egotism of \\\"Jonathan\\\" Kongre is well shown by Yul Brynner's performance, but the subtlety of that trait is lost. The writers presumably did not think the audience could appreciate it. Kirk Douglas does well enough as Denton, but his singlehanded success (Vasquez and Davis work together well to the end of the story, unlike Denton's ally who is killed by the pirates) seems unlikely. The bestiality of the pirates is well shown in the movie, particularly a singularly tall actor who in one scene wears women's clothing to particularly unsettling effect. The film is not a bad minor adventure film, but it could have been better if they had stuck to Verne's theme.\",\n          \"The Light At The Edge of the World marks Kirk Douglas's second filming of a Jules Verne novel. The first of course was one of his most popular films 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea. But this film is far more serious and has far more adult themes than Walt Disney's film aimed for the kid trade.This was the last novel Jules Verne had published during his lifetime and it's a story of survival against almost impossible odds. In the original novel Kirk Douglas's character was named Vasquez which certainly was more in keeping with someone assigned to lighthouse duty on Cape Horn. But in giving Douglas's character an Anglo name it better explains his presence on the island and it certainly is in keeping with the international tradition of Jules Verne's writings.Cape Horn is one of the loneliest parts of the globe and the geography of the southern tip of South America. Look on a map of the many islands and rocks in that part of the globe and imagine how rough the sea is because it has only limited space. It's not without reason that sailors in all cultures say that no one is really a true sailor until they've made a voyage crossing from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean in that area. Remember also this is 1865 as Yul Brynner identifies the year and the Panama Canal had not been built.Which makes the lighthouse at Cape Horn an international concern which was something that is ever present in Jules Verne's writings. But then as now there are malevolent forces in the world and they are in this story Yul Brynner and his pirate crew.On one desultory like any other down there, Yul Brynner's ship docks at the island and kills lighthouse keeper Fernando Rey and his young assistant Massimo Ranieri. By sheer dumb luck Douglas is not at the lighthouse when this happens, but he becomes a hunted man by Brynner and his pirate crew who want to set up headquarters there and use the light to pile up as many wrecks as they can plunder. Also they want to eliminate Douglas who's now the only witness to their crimes.I did like this film very much both when first seeing it in the theater and now on VHS. One thing of interest I found here is that there is no ambiguity, no shadings of character. Kirk Douglas is a good guy and Yul Brynner a bad one, no one is going to walk away thinking anything else. In fact Yul Brynner's pirate captain Jonathan Kongre is the most unredeemable villain we've seen on screen since Lee Marvin as Liberty Valance.Definitely fans of Kirk Douglas, Yul Brynner and Jules Verne should earmark this film for their collection.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"keywords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Here are the keywords extracted from the text:\\n\\n*   Jules Verne\\n*   Hollywood\\n*   Yul Brynner\\n*   Cruelty\\n*   Domination\\n*   Douglass\\n*   Solitude\\n*   Samantha Egger\\n*   Sacrifice\\n*   Movie review\\n*   Film conventions\\n*   Aging film\\n*   Lack of special effects\\n*   Thought-provoking (implied by \\\"substitutes for thought\\\")\",\n          \"Here's a list of keywords extracted from the text, categorized for clarity:\\n\\n**Authors & People:**\\n*   Jules Verne\\n*   Michael Verne\\n*   Captain Nemo\\n*   Robur\\n*   Kongre (Jonathan Kongre)\\n*   Vasquez\\n*   John Davis\\n*   Carcante\\n*   V\",\n          \"Here's a list of keywords extracted from the text, categorized for clarity:\\n\\n**Film & Production:**\\n*   The Light At The Edge of the World\\n*   Kirk Douglas\\n*   Jules Verne (novel, writings)\\n*   20,000 Leagues Under The Sea\\n*   Walt Disney\\n*   Yul Brynner\\n*   Fernando Rey\\n*   Massimo Ranieri\\n*   Jonathan Kongre (Yul Brynner's character)\\n*   Film / Movie\\n*   Novel (source material)\\n*   VHS (viewing format)\\n\\n**Themes & Concepts:**\\n*   Survival\\n*   Impossible odds\\n*   Adult themes\\n*   International tradition\\n*   Malevolent forces\\n*   Pirate crew\\n*   Villain\\n*   Witness\\n*   No ambiguity (characterization)\\n\\n**Locations & Setting:**\\n*   Cape Horn\\n*   Lighthouse\\n*   Island\\n*   Southern tip of South America\\n*   Atlantic Ocean\\n*   Pacific Ocean\\n*   Panama Canal (historical context)\\n\\n**Time Period:**\\n*   1865\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Also, there is an excellent degrading of the film stock which chills the mind if you like faded greys and yellows as I do. This film is played on TNT from time to time so see it.\",\n          \"Jules Verne wrote about 80 novels as well as plays and short stories in his career. He began writing in 1854 with a short story called \\\"Master Zacharias, or the Clockmaker's Soul\\\". It was the first time he talked of the negative side of progress - the evil that results from some discoveries or inventions when they fall into the wrong hands. This becomes a running theme in his novels: Captain Nemo in TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA, or Robur (from ROBUR THE CONQUEROR and it's sequel, THE MASTER OF THE WORLD) are two of his best examples of this them. Kongre, in THE LIGHTHOUSE AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD, is another.Verne was so prolific that when he died in 1905 he left a dozen unpublished novels and stories that were not fully published until 1910. They include some of his best writing, such as THE BARSAC MISSION (partly written by Verne's son Michael), THE SURVIVORS OF THE \\\"JONATHAN\\\", THE PURSUIT OF THE METEOR, THE DANUBE PILOT. All of these dealt with science, but also dealt with political systems, and economics, for Verne was interested in all the problems facing modern man. THE LIGHTHOUSE AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD was the last novel that was published in Verne's lifetime. It does not deal with the political questions or economic ones that perplexed him, but seems to go back to his potboiler period, when he was turning out stories for money while considering better stories for later publication. But nothing Verne wrote is without interest. Rereading THE LIGHTHOUSE one sees what the subtle point is in it. It is the study of how the ego of a villain can prevent him from escaping retribution.Kongre (renamed Jonathan Kongre) is one of the last pirates in the world of 1900. He and his gang find a damaged boat and repair it. They sail it across the Pacific, and reach Staten Island, a small island in the Straits of Magellan controlled by Chile. There they find a lighthouse with a crew of three men. They manage to kill two of them, but the third one (named Vasquez - he's from Chile, remember), hides on the island. Kongre and his men decide that they should prepare to leave the island shortly, before the Chilean Naval relief boat returns in three months to pick up the lighthouse crew. But first they will wreck any boat that comes to the passage, and increase their ill-gotten gains. But the key to the novel (and it is not in the movie) is that Kongre's right hand men (Carcante and Vargas) keep urging him to pack up his supplies and wealth and head to Asia where the money can be divvied up and everyone separate in safety. And each time Kongre won't do it. Initially it is pure greed. He wrecks a boat, and massacres the crew (a scene that is done in the film). The sole survivor is an American, John Davis (the name became Denton in the film, except that it was given to the character of Vasquez). Now with an ally (and not a drunken one, as in the film), Vasquez starts sabotaging Kongre's activities on the island. Carcante keeps suggesting leaving, but Kongre (unused to someone annoying him successfully) keeps delaying in order to catch Vasquez and Davis. The end result is that when he thinks he has them cornered, the Chilean boat appears to sink his craft, kill most of his crew, and confront him. Kongre commits suicide to avoid capture.Much of the mayhem of the movie (with Denton picking off crew members one at a time) is not in the book. Nor is there any female character in the novel (a rarity in most of Verne's stories - he could be quite a feminist when he wished). The egotism of \\\"Jonathan\\\" Kongre is well shown by Yul Brynner's performance, but the subtlety of that trait is lost. The writers presumably did not think the audience could appreciate it. Kirk Douglas does well enough as Denton, but his singlehanded success (Vasquez and Davis work together well to the end of the story, unlike Denton's ally who is killed by the pirates) seems unlikely. The bestiality of the pirates is well shown in the movie, particularly a singularly tall actor who in one scene wears women's clothing to particularly unsettling effect. The film is not a bad minor adventure film, but it could have been better if they had stuck to Verne's theme.\",\n          \"Surprising that Jules Verne would write such a story. Even more surprising that Hollywood would produce it. Yul Brynner is unbelievably good as a man freed of all bounds of convention, free to indulge his taste for cruelty and domination. Douglass is an excellent counterpoint, a courageous individual who's chosen simple solitude as a way to deal with the complications and turmoil society had imposed on him. And Samantha Egger's character is the capper, a woman willing to sacrifice far too much for comfort and safety. Inotherwords, everyman. The movie does show its age and is limited by the conventions of time and place and technology of the time. If you're looking for special effects and action as substitutes for thought, look elsewhere.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"keywords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

He began writing in 1854 with a short story called \\\"Master Zacharias, or the Clockmaker's Soul\\\". It was the first time he talked of the negative side of progress - the evil that results from some discoveries or inventions when they fall into the wrong hands. This becomes a running theme in his novels: Captain Nemo in TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA, or Robur (from ROBUR THE CONQUEROR and it's sequel, THE MASTER OF THE WORLD) are two of his best examples of this them. Kongre, in THE LIGHTHOUSE AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD, is another.Verne was so prolific that when he died in 1905 he left a dozen unpublished novels and stories that were not fully published until 1910. They include some of his best writing, such as THE BARSAC MISSION (partly written by Verne's son Michael), THE SURVIVORS OF THE \\\"JONATHAN\\\", THE PURSUIT OF THE METEOR, THE DANUBE PILOT. All of these dealt with science, but also dealt with political systems, and economics, for Verne was interested in all the problems facing modern man. THE LIGHTHOUSE AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD was the last novel that was published in Verne's lifetime. It does not deal with the political questions or economic ones that perplexed him, but seems to go back to his potboiler period, when he was turning out stories for money while considering better stories for later publication. But nothing Verne wrote is without interest. Rereading THE LIGHTHOUSE one sees what the subtle point is in it. It is the study of how the ego of a villain can prevent him from escaping retribution.Kongre (renamed Jonathan Kongre) is one of the last pirates in the world of 1900. He and his gang find a damaged boat and repair it. They sail it across the Pacific, and reach Staten Island, a small island in the Straits of Magellan controlled by Chile. There they find a lighthouse with a crew of three men. They manage to kill two of them, but the third one (named Vasquez - he's from Chile, remember), hides on the island. Kongre and his men decide that they should prepare to leave the island shortly, before the Chilean Naval relief boat returns in three months to pick up the lighthouse crew. But first they will wreck any boat that comes to the passage, and increase their ill-gotten gains. But the key to the novel (and it is not in the movie) is that Kongre's right hand men (Carcante and Vargas) keep urging him to pack up his supplies and wealth and head to Asia where the money can be divvied up and everyone separate in safety. And each time Kongre won't do it. Initially it is pure greed. He wrecks a boat, and massacres the crew (a scene that is done in the film). The sole survivor is an American, John Davis (the name became Denton in the film, except that it was given to the character of Vasquez). Now with an ally (and not a drunken one, as in the film), Vasquez starts sabotaging Kongre's activities on the island. Carcante keeps suggesting leaving, but Kongre (unused to someone annoying him successfully) keeps delaying in order to catch Vasquez and Davis. The end result is that when he thinks he has them cornered, the Chilean boat appears to sink his craft, kill most of his crew, and confront him. Kongre commits suicide to avoid capture.Much of the mayhem of the movie (with Denton picking off crew members one at a time) is not in the book. Nor is there any female character in the novel (a rarity in most of Verne's stories - he could be quite a feminist when he wished). The egotism of \\\"Jonathan\\\" Kongre is well shown by Yul Brynner's performance, but the subtlety of that trait is lost. The writers presumably did not think the audience could appreciate it. Kirk Douglas does well enough as Denton, but his singlehanded success (Vasquez and Davis work together well to the end of the story, unlike Denton's ally who is killed by the pirates) seems unlikely. The bestiality of the pirates is well shown in the movie, particularly a singularly tall actor who in one scene wears women's clothing to particularly unsettling effect. The film is not a bad minor adventure film, but it could have been better if they had stuck to Verne's theme.\",\n          \"Remove yourself from the Kirk Douglass aspects of the casting. It is essential to your enjoying the film. There is a beautiful young woman playing double roles - and in the photos from the 1800's, I can't believe how smooth and white her skin is. Also, there is an excellent degrading of the film stock which chills the mind if you like faded greys and yellows as I do. This film is played on TNT from time to time so see it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"full_response\",\n

He began writing in 1854 with a short story called \\\"Master Zacharias, or the Clockmaker's Soul\\\". It was the first time he talked of the negative side of progress - the evil that results from some discoveries or inventions when they fall into the wrong hands. This becomes a running theme in his novels: Captain Nemo in TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA, or Robur (from ROBUR THE CONQUEROR and it's sequel, THE MASTER OF THE WORLD) are two of his best examples of this them. Kongre, in THE LIGHTHOUSE AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD, is another.Verne was so prolific that when he died in 1905 he left a dozen unpublished novels and stories that were not fully published until 1910. They include some of his best writing, such as THE BARSAC MISSION (partly written by Verne's son Michael), THE SURVIVORS OF THE \\\"JONATHAN\\\", THE PURSUIT OF THE METEOR, THE DANUBE PILOT. All of these dealt with science, but also dealt with political systems, and economics, for Verne was interested in all the problems facing modern man. THE LIGHTHOUSE AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD was the last novel that was published in Verne's lifetime. It does not deal with the political questions or economic ones that perplexed him, but seems to go back to his potboiler period, when he was turning out stories for money while considering better stories for later publication. But nothing Verne wrote is without interest. Rereading THE LIGHTHOUSE one sees what the subtle point is in it. It is the study of how the ego of a villain can prevent him from escaping retribution.Kongre (renamed Jonathan Kongre) is one of the last pirates in the world of 1900. He and his gang find a damaged boat and repair it. They sail it across the Pacific, and reach Staten Island, a small island in the Straits of Magellan controlled by Chile. There they find a lighthouse with a crew of three men. They manage to kill two of them, but the third one (named Vasquez - he's from Chile, remember), hides on the island. Kongre and his men decide that they should prepare to leave the island shortly, before the Chilean Naval relief boat returns in three months to pick up the lighthouse crew. But first they will wreck any boat that comes to the passage, and increase their ill-gotten gains. But the key to the novel (and it is not in the movie) is that Kongre's right hand men (Carcante and Vargas) keep urging him to pack up his supplies and wealth and head to Asia where the money can be divvied up and everyone separate in safety. And each time Kongre won't do it. Initially it is pure greed. He wrecks a boat, and massacres the crew (a scene that is done in the film). The sole survivor is an American, John Davis (the name became Denton in the film, except that it was given to the character of Vasquez). Now with an ally (and not a drunken one, as in the film), Vasquez starts sabotaging Kongre's activities on the island. Carcante keeps suggesting leaving, but Kongre (unused to someone annoying him successfully) keeps delaying in order to catch Vasquez and Davis. The end result is that when he thinks he has them cornered, the Chilean boat appears to sink his craft, kill most of his crew, and confront him. Kongre commits suicide to avoid capture.Much of the mayhem of the movie (with Denton picking off crew members one at a time) is not in the book. Nor is there any female character in the novel (a rarity in most of Verne's stories - he could be quite a feminist when he wished). The egotism of \\\"Jonathan\\\" Kongre is well shown by Yul Brynner's performance, but the subtlety of that trait is lost. The writers presumably did not think the audience could appreciate it. Kirk Douglas does well enough as Denton, but his singlehanded success (Vasquez and Davis work together well to the end of the story, unlike Denton's ally who is killed by the pirates) seems unlikely. The bestiality of the pirates is well shown in the movie, particularly a singularly tall actor who in one scene wears women's clothing to particularly unsettling effect. The film is not a bad minor adventure film, but it could have been better if they had stuck to Verne's theme.\",\n          \"Remove yourself from the Kirk Douglass aspects of the casting. It is essential to your enjoying the film. There is a beautiful young woman playing double roles - and in the photos from the 1800's, I can't believe how smooth and white her skin is. Also, there is an excellent degrading of the film stock which chills the mind if you like faded greys and yellows as I do. This film is played on TNT from time to time so see it.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"keywords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Neutral\",\n          \"Positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

This film is played on TNT from time to time so see it.\",\n          \"Jules Verne wrote about 80 novels as well as plays and short stories in his career. He began writing in 1854 with a short story called \\\"Master Zacharias, or the Clockmaker's Soul\\\". It was the first time he talked of the negative side of progress - the evil that results from some discoveries or inventions when they fall into the wrong hands. This becomes a running theme in his novels: Captain Nemo in TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA, or Robur (from ROBUR THE CONQUEROR and it's sequel, THE MASTER OF THE WORLD) are two of his best examples of this them. Kongre, in THE LIGHTHOUSE AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD, is another.Verne was so prolific that when he died in 1905 he left a dozen unpublished novels and stories that were not fully published until 1910. They include some of his best writing, such as THE BARSAC MISSION (partly written by Verne's son Michael), THE SURVIVORS OF THE \\\"JONATHAN\\\", THE PURSUIT OF THE METEOR, THE DANUBE PILOT. All of these dealt with science, but also dealt with political systems, and economics, for Verne was interested in all the problems facing modern man. THE LIGHTHOUSE AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD was the last novel that was published in Verne's lifetime. It does not deal with the political questions or economic ones that perplexed him, but seems to go back to his potboiler period, when he was turning out stories for money while considering better stories for later publication. But nothing Verne wrote is without interest. Rereading THE LIGHTHOUSE one sees what the subtle point is in it. It is the study of how the ego of a villain can prevent him from escaping retribution.Kongre (renamed Jonathan Kongre) is one of the last pirates in the world of 1900. He and his gang find a damaged boat and repair it. They sail it across the Pacific, and reach Staten Island, a small island in the Straits of Magellan controlled by Chile. There they find a lighthouse with a crew of three men. They manage to kill two of them, but the third one (named Vasquez - he's from Chile, remember), hides on the island. Kongre and his men decide that they should prepare to leave the island shortly, before the Chilean Naval relief boat returns in three months to pick up the lighthouse crew. But first they will wreck any boat that comes to the passage, and increase their ill-gotten gains. But the key to the novel (and it is not in the movie) is that Kongre's right hand men (Carcante and Vargas) keep urging him to pack up his supplies and wealth and head to Asia where the money can be divvied up and everyone separate in safety. And each time Kongre won't do it. Initially it is pure greed. He wrecks a boat, and massacres the crew (a scene that is done in the film). The sole survivor is an American, John Davis (the name became Denton in the film, except that it was given to the character of Vasquez). Now with an ally (and not a drunken one, as in the film), Vasquez starts sabotaging Kongre's activities on the island. Carcante keeps suggesting leaving, but Kongre (unused to someone annoying him successfully) keeps delaying in order to catch Vasquez and Davis. The end result is that when he thinks he has them cornered, the Chilean boat appears to sink his craft, kill most of his crew, and confront him. Kongre commits suicide to avoid capture.Much of the mayhem of the movie (with Denton picking off crew members one at a time) is not in the book. Nor is there any female character in the novel (a rarity in most of Verne's stories - he could be quite a feminist when he wished). The egotism of \\\"Jonathan\\\" Kongre is well shown by Yul Brynner's performance, but the subtlety of that trait is lost. The writers presumably did not think the audience could appreciate it. Kirk Douglas does well enough as Denton, but his singlehanded success (Vasquez and Davis work together well to the end of the story, unlike Denton's ally who is killed by the pirates) seems unlikely. The bestiality of the pirates is well shown in the movie, particularly a singularly tall actor who in one scene wears women's clothing to particularly unsettling effect. The film is not a bad minor adventure film, but it could have been better if they had stuck to Verne's theme.\",\n          \"Surprising that Jules Verne would write such a story. Even more surprising that Hollywood would produce it. Yul Brynner is unbelievably good as a man freed of all bounds of convention, free to indulge his taste for cruelty and domination. Douglass is an excellent counterpoint, a courageous individual who's chosen simple solitude as a way to deal with the complications and turmoil society had imposed on him. And Samantha Egger's character is the capper, a woman willing to sacrifice far too much for comfort and safety. Inotherwords, everyman. The movie does show its age and is limited by the conventions of time and place and technology of the time. If you're looking for special effects and action as substitutes for thought, look elsewhere.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"keywords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Neutral\",\n          \"Positive\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

Also, there is an excellent degrading of the film stock which chills the mind if you like faded greys and yellows as I do. This film is played on TNT from time to time so see it.\",\n          \"Jules Verne wrote about 80 novels as well as plays and short stories in his career. He began writing in 1854 with a short story called \\\"Master Zacharias, or the Clockmaker's Soul\\\". It was the first time he talked of the negative side of progress - the evil that results from some discoveries or inventions when they fall into the wrong hands. This becomes a running theme in his novels: Captain Nemo in TWENTY THOUSAND LEAGUES UNDER THE SEA, or Robur (from ROBUR THE CONQUEROR and it's sequel, THE MASTER OF THE WORLD) are two of his best examples of this them. Kongre, in THE LIGHTHOUSE AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD, is another.Verne was so prolific that when he died in 1905 he left a dozen unpublished novels and stories that were not fully published until 1910. They include some of his best writing, such as THE BARSAC MISSION (partly written by Verne's son Michael), THE SURVIVORS OF THE \\\"JONATHAN\\\", THE PURSUIT OF THE METEOR, THE DANUBE PILOT. All of these dealt with science, but also dealt with political systems, and economics, for Verne was interested in all the problems facing modern man. THE LIGHTHOUSE AT THE EDGE OF THE WORLD was the last novel that was published in Verne's lifetime. It does not deal with the political questions or economic ones that perplexed him, but seems to go back to his potboiler period, when he was turning out stories for money while considering better stories for later publication. But nothing Verne wrote is without interest. Rereading THE LIGHTHOUSE one sees what the subtle point is in it. It is the study of how the ego of a villain can prevent him from escaping retribution.Kongre (renamed Jonathan Kongre) is one of the last pirates in the world of 1900. He and his gang find a damaged boat and repair it. They sail it across the Pacific, and reach Staten Island, a small island in the Straits of Magellan controlled by Chile. There they find a lighthouse with a crew of three men. They manage to kill two of them, but the third one (named Vasquez - he's from Chile, remember), hides on the island. Kongre and his men decide that they should prepare to leave the island shortly, before the Chilean Naval relief boat returns in three months to pick up the lighthouse crew. But first they will wreck any boat that comes to the passage, and increase their ill-gotten gains. But the key to the novel (and it is not in the movie) is that Kongre's right hand men (Carcante and Vargas) keep urging him to pack up his supplies and wealth and head to Asia where the money can be divvied up and everyone separate in safety. And each time Kongre won't do it. Initially it is pure greed. He wrecks a boat, and massacres the crew (a scene that is done in the film). The sole survivor is an American, John Davis (the name became Denton in the film, except that it was given to the character of Vasquez). Now with an ally (and not a drunken one, as in the film), Vasquez starts sabotaging Kongre's activities on the island. Carcante keeps suggesting leaving, but Kongre (unused to someone annoying him successfully) keeps delaying in order to catch Vasquez and Davis. The end result is that when he thinks he has them cornered, the Chilean boat appears to sink his craft, kill most of his crew, and confront him. Kongre commits suicide to avoid capture.Much of the mayhem of the movie (with Denton picking off crew members one at a time) is not in the book. Nor is there any female character in the novel (a rarity in most of Verne's stories - he could be quite a feminist when he wished). The egotism of \\\"Jonathan\\\" Kongre is well shown by Yul Brynner's performance, but the subtlety of that trait is lost. The writers presumably did not think the audience could appreciate it. Kirk Douglas does well enough as Denton, but his singlehanded success (Vasquez and Davis work together well to the end of the story, unlike Denton's ally who is killed by the pirates) seems unlikely. The bestiality of the pirates is well shown in the movie, particularly a singularly tall actor who in one scene wears women's clothing to particularly unsettling effect. The film is not a bad minor adventure film, but it could have been better if they had stuck to Verne's theme.\",\n          \"Surprising that Jules Verne would write such a story. Even more surprising that Hollywood would produce it. Yul Brynner is unbelievably good as a man freed of all bounds of convention, free to indulge his taste for cruelty and domination. Douglass is an excellent counterpoint, a courageous individual who's chosen simple solitude as a way to deal with the complications and turmoil society had imposed on him. And Samantha Egger's character is the capper, a woman willing to sacrifice far too much for comfort and safety. Inotherwords, everyman. The movie does show its age and is limited by the conventions of time and place and technology of the time. If you're looking for special effects and action as substitutes for thought, look elsewhere.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"response\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Keywords:\\n- Kirk Douglass\\n- casting\\n- beautiful young woman\\n- double roles\\n- 1800's\\n- smooth and white skin\\n- excellent degrading of the film stock\\n- faded greys and yellows\\n- TNT\\n\\nSentiment:\\nPositive\\n\\nThe review expresses a positive sentiment overall.
