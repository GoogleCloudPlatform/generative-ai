It employs various prompts to guide the model in extracting information from existing resumes, generating professional summaries tailored to specific job descriptions, and arranging skills and coursework in order of relevance. The prompts emphasize maintaining truthfulness, using active voice, and adhering to a valid JSON format for the output. This approach allows for the creation of customized and targeted resumes that effectively highlight relevant qualifications and experiences."
