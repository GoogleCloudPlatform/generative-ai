# --- Authentication ---
# Authentication to Google Cloud is typically handled via Application Default Credentials (ADC).
# Ensure you have authenticated by running:
# gcloud auth application-default login
# The GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable can also be used to point to a service account key file,
# but ADC is generally preferred for local development and Cloud environments.
# GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/service-account-key.json"
