        "- Quality: The model maintains quality comparable to larger models like Gemini 1.5 Pro and GPT-4o.\n",
        "- Improved agentic experiences: Gemini 2.0 delivers improvements to multimodal understanding, coding, complex instruction following, and function calling.\n",
        "- New Modalities: Gemini 2.0 introduces native image generation and controllable text-to-speech capabilities, enabling image editing, localized artwork creation, and expressive storytelling.\n",
