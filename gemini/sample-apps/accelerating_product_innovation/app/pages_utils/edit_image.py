"""
This module provides functions for image processing and session state
management
related to image editing.  This module:
* process_foreground_image():
    * Prepares a foreground image for merging with a background.
    * Optionally removes white regions for background editing.
* initialize_edit_page_state():  Initializes session state for the
  image editing
page and handles uploaded images.
* handle_image_upload(): Manages the image upload process and updates session
 state.
* save_draft_image(): Saves edited draft images and facilitates a return to
 the product
generation page.
* generate_suggested_images():
    * Generates image variations based on text prompts, an initial image, and
      an optional mask.
* render_suggested_images():
    * Displays generated suggestions in a grid.
    * Provides "Edit" and "Download" buttons for each suggestion.
* _handle_edit_suggestion():
    * Handles the logic for editing a selected suggestion.
