    Handles chat interactions for a guardrail agent by streaming responses from a remote LangGraph.

    This function takes a user message and a thread ID, and streams responses from a remote LangGraph.
    It parses the streamed chunks, which can contain guardrail classifications, text responses, or errors,
    and formats them into a human-readable text stream.

    Args:
        message (str): The user's input message.
        thread_id (str): The ID of the chat thread.

    Yields:
        str: Formatted text chunks representing guardrail classifications, text responses, or errors.
