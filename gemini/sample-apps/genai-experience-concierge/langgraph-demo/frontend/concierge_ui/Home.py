The Gen AI Experience Concierge demo consists of a few chat interfaces for some langgraph agents deployed as FastAPI servers.

Each agent server is compatible with the [LangGraph Cloud API](langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/reference/api/api_ref.html). Not all functionality/endpoints are supported (especially the multi-assistant endpoints). A minimal subset of endpoints required by the [langgraph_sdk.RemoteGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/reference/remote_graph/) interface. The `RemoteGraph` interface is an implementation of the `PregelProtocol`, the same protocol used by `CompiledGraph` (the local LangGraph class), making usage between locally built graphs and remote server graphs seamless.
