# LangGraph Agent Backend Server

This directory demonstrates how to build each of the agent design patterns and host them on a server. This is accomplished using the `langgraph_server` module to convert any LangGraph `StateGraph` object into a FastAPI router that implements a subset of the [LangGraph Cloud API](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/reference/api/api_ref.html) required to use the RemoteGraph protocol. This enables the usage of standard LangGraph clients to build agent UIs, including graph visualization, streaming, async/sync invocation, and all of the powerful state management and time-travel features of LangGraph.

## Getting Started

### Environment Setup

Clone the repository and ensure that the Google Application Default Credentials are configured. You can do this by running the following commands:

```bash
# Clone repository and navigate to project root directory
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai.git
cd gemini/sample-apps/genai-experience-concierge

# Set up Google Application Default Credentials
gcloud auth login
gcloud auth application-default login
```

### (Optional) Create the Cymbal Retail dataset

The function calling demo agent requires a BigQuery dataset to exist to query a fictional retail dataset. This is automatically created during demo deployment, but must be manually created if the demo project doesn't exist. To manually create these tables, you can run this command:

```bash
uv run --frozen concierge langgraph create-dataset --project-id $PROJECT_ID
```

### Run the server

To start the backend server, open a new terminal window, navigate to `langgraph-demo/backend` and run:

```bash
uv run --frozen uvicorn concierge.server:app --port 3000 --reload
```

### Access the Agent API endpoints

The auto-generated FastAPI documentation by will be available at `/docs` (Swagger) or `/redoc` (Redoc).

The server exposes the following API routes for interacting with the different agents:

- `/gemini`: For interacting with the general-purpose Gemini chat agent.
- `/gemini-with-guardrails`: For interacting with the Gemini chat agent with guardrails.
- `/function-calling`: For interacting with the function calling agent.
- `/semantic-router`: For interacting with the semantic router agent.
- `/task-planner`: For interacting with the task planner agent.

Each agent's route provides endpoints for invoking the agent, managing conversation state, and retrieving conversation history:

- **`GET /assistants/{assistant_id}/graph`**: This route retrieves the graph structure associated with a specific assistant, identified by its `assistant_id` (unused since each route only hosts one agent). This is used to draw a visualization of the graph.

- **`POST /threads/{thread_id}/state/checkpoint`**: This route is used to get a specific checkpoint of the state for a thread, identified by its `thread_id`. The request body contains the checkpoint configuration.

- **`GET /threads/{thread_id}/state`**: This route retrieves the current state of a specific thread, identified by its `thread_id`.

- **`POST /threads/{thread_id}/history`**: This route retrieves the history of state changes for a specific thread, identified by its `thread_id`.

- **`POST /threads/{thread_id}/state`**: This route updates the state of a specific thread, identified by its `thread_id`.

- **`POST /runs/stream`**: This route initiates a stateless run of an agent and streams the results. This can only be called if the agent is compiled **without a checkpointer**.

- **`POST /threads/{thread_id}/runs/stream`**: This route initiates a run within a specific thread, identified by its `thread_id`, and streams the results. This can only be called if the agent is compiled **with a checkpointer**.

## Key Features

- **Diverse Agent Implementations:** The demo showcases several distinct agent design patterns (see [Agent Design Patterns](../../agent-design-patterns/) for more details):

  1. **Gemini Chat:** [Source Code](./concierge/agents/gemini_chat/)
     - Purpose: A general-purpose conversational agent with a system prompt to take on the role of a Retail Assistant built with the Gemini language model. It handles basic user queries and maintains conversation context.
     - Streams: Response text generated by Gemini.
  1. **Gemini Chat with Guardrails:** [Source Code](./concierge/agents/gemini_chat_with_guardrails/)
     - Purpose: An enhanced Retail Assistant agent that incorporates guardrails to ensure safe and appropriate responses. It classifies user inputs and blocks potentially harmful or out-of-scope requests.
     - Streams: Guardrail classifications and response text.
  1. **Function Calling:** [Source Code](./concierge/agents/function_calling/)
     - Purpose: This Retail Assistant agent demonstrates how to integrate function calling with LangGraph. It can use tools to retrieve real-time data (e.g. product information, stores, inventory) and incorporate the results into its responses.
     - Streams: Function calls, function responses, and response text.
     - Available tools:
       - `find_products`: Search for products based on various criteria (e.g., store, price, keywords).
       - `find_stores`: Search for stores based on name, location, or products offered.
       - `find_inventory`: Check the inventory of a specific product at a store.
  1. **Semantic Router:** [Source Code](./concierge/agents/semantic_router/)
     - Purpose: A useful component for multi-agent systems, this agent intelligently routes user queries to the most appropriate specialized agent (i.e. Retail Assistant or Customer Support Assistant) based on the query's semantic content.
     - Streams: Routing decision and response text.
  1. **Task Planner:** [Source Code](./concierge/agents/task_planner/)
     - Purpose: This advanced multi-agent design can break down complex user requests into step-by-step plans, execute those plans (e.g., using search), and then reflect on the results to provide comprehensive responses.
     - Streams: Generated plans, each executed task, plan reflection, and response text.

- **LangGraph for Agent Orchestration:** LangGraph is used as the core framework for defining the interaction flows between agents. It enables the creation of robust, stateful, and multi-turn conversations.

- **FastAPI Integration:** The project leverages FastAPI to expose the LangGraph agents as a set of REST API endpoints. This makes it easy to deploy and access the agents from other applications.

- **Modular Design:** Each agent folder (under [concierge/agents](./concierge/agents/)) is a self-contained LangGraph agent implementation with no other assumptions about the rest of this project. This means you're free to just copy any of those folders and use it as you would with any other LangGraph agent. The one requirement that we make to enable runtime configuration is that the `AgentConfig` for each respective agent is passed during invocation to configure project, models, tables, etc. See an example for the Gemini agent below:

  ```python
  from langgraph.checkpoint import memory

  from concierge.agents.gemini_chat import graph, schemas

  # Standard LangGraph compilation step
  state_graph = graph.load_graph()
  compiled_graph = state_graph.compile(checkpointer=memory.MemorySaver())

  # Runtime configuration
  agent_config = schemas.AgentConfig(
      project="...",
      region="us-central1",
      chat_model_name="gemini-2.0-flash-001",
  )

  # Run an example streamed query
  async for chunk in compiled_graph.astream(
      input=schemas.GraphTurnInput(
          current_turn=schemas.Turn(
              user_input="Can you create an overview of each department and their top selling products?"
          )
      ),
      # Note that the agent_config is passed in addition to the standard thread ID configuration
      config={"configurable": {"thread_id": "test-thread", "agent_config": agent_config}},
      stream_mode="custom",
  ):
      print(chunk["text"], end="")
  ```

- **Checkpointing:** The agent server can be configured to leverage LangGraph's checkpointer implementations to persist session state with various backends: in-memory, SQLite, and Postgres.

## LangGraph to FastAPI Conversion

The `langgraph_server` directory contains the essential components for converting LangGraph graphs into deployable FastAPI applications:

- `langgraph_agent.py`: This file defines the `LangGraphAgent` class, which wraps a LangGraph `StateGraph` and provides methods for interacting with it (e.g., getting graph structure, managing state, streaming execution). It acts as an adapter between LangGraph's logic and the server.
- `fastapi_app.py`: This file contains the `build_agent_router` function, which takes a `LangGraphAgent` and a FastAPI `APIRouter` and sets up the API endpoints for interacting with the agent. It handles request processing, serialization, and streaming responses using FastAPI.
- `schemas.py`: Defines the Pydantic models used for request and response data, ensuring data validation and type safety in the API.
- `checkpoint_saver.py`: Provides functions for loading, setting up, and cleaning up different checkpointing backends, allowing the server to manage conversation state persistence.

## Interactive Jupyter Notebooks ðŸ““

Some development notebooks are provided to interactively test both the local implementation of the agents and deployed agents.

- [notebooks/langgraph-agent.ipynb](./notebooks/langgraph-agent.ipynb): Build and compile a simple LangGraph graph, wrap it in a `LangGraphAgent` running locally within the notebook, display the graph visualization, and run some simple tests.
- [notebooks/langgraph-remote-agent.ipynb](./notebooks/langgraph-remote-agent.ipynb): Query a remote instance of the "Gemini Chat" example agent server (either at localhost or a deployed endpoint). Display a visualization of the remote graph and run some simple tests.
