        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "### Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates an implementation of a task planner agent (similar to [\"Deep Research\"](https://gemini.google/overview/deep-research)) This is a multi-agent architecture useful for tasks requiring more complex reasoning, planning, and multi-tool use.\n",
        "\n",
        "This architecture is often much slower than single-agent designs because a single turn can consist of a large number of LLM calls and tool usage. This demo is particularly slow because the \"Executor\" agent only supports linear plans and executes each task in parallel. There is research on alternative approaches such as [LLM Compiler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.04511) that attempt to improve this design by constructing DAGs to enable parallel task execution.\n",
        "\n",
        "The \"Executor\" agent in this demo is a Gemini model equipped with the Google Search Grounding Tool ([documentation](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/ground-with-google-search)) to enable live web search while executing tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Components\n",
        "\n",
        "The task planner agent is built around several key components:\n",
        "\n",
        "* **Language Model:** Gemini is used for natural language understanding, function calling, and response generation for multiple agents.\n",
        "* **State Management:** LangGraph manages the conversation flow and maintains the session state, including conversation history and generated/executed plans.\n",
        "* **Planner Node:** Generates a plan or a direct response to the user input. The plan consists of a sequence of tasks to be executed.\n",
        "* **Executor Node:** Executes the tasks defined in the plan, typically using tools like Google Search to gather information.\n",
        "* **Reflector Node:** Analyzes the results of the executed plan and the user's input to determine the next action - either generating a new plan for further execution or formulating a final response to the user.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Workflow\n",
        "\n",
        "The agent operates through the following workflow:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. The **Planner** receives user input and either (1) responds directly to simple queries (e.g. \"Hi\") or (2) generates a research plan, including list of tasks to execute.\n",
        "1. The **Executor** receives the plan and uses its tools to perform each task and update the plan with the executed task result.\n",
        "1. The **Reflector** reviews the executed plan and either (1) generates a final response to the user or (2) generates a new plan and jumps back to step 2."

The console versions have a \"Teen\" rating from the ESRB [14, 15]. You navigate dynastic politics, wars, and religious conflicts, making strategic decisions about marriages, alliances, and kingdom management [16, 12]. The game strives for historical authenticity in its depiction of medieval titles, the feudal system, and the importance of religion [6, 12]. However, it does take liberties with historical accuracy to ensure balanced gameplay [6, 11, 18]. For instance, feudal raiding is restricted, and feudalism is represented in a somewhat uniform way, even though it varied greatly across regions [6, 11]. Despite these inaccuracies, the game can teach players about medieval geography, cultures, faiths, and the lives of historical figures [12].\n",

You start as a young peasant and build a village and dynasty, experiencing aspects of medieval life like farming, hunting, crafting, and trading [5, 21]. \"Medieval Dynasty\" has a \"Teen\" rating [5]. The game has elements inspired by a specific period of European history [1]. The game may feature characters using mild language such as \"d*mn\" and \"b*st*rd\" [5]. Violence is primarily directed at animals and bandits, with blood effects [5]. Some side quests can have dark themes such as torture, adultery and rape [5]. The developers drew inspiration from games like \"Kingdom Come: Deliverance\" for visual elements and historical accuracy [17]. However, the game prioritizes gameplay over strict historical accuracy [7].\n",

Players manage resources, construct buildings inspired by 14th-century Franconian art and architecture, and can engage in battles to expand their territory [3, 8, 27, 28, 30]. While awaiting an official ESRB rating, sources indicate that it is generally considered acceptable for younger players due to its limited combat and blood effects [23]. The developer prioritizes historical accuracy where possible, avoiding common medieval tropes to create an authentic world [2, 8, 27, 30]. For example, building mechanics are inspired by the growth of real medieval towns [3, 27, 30]. While the game strives for historical accuracy, the developer acknowledges that nothing can be truly historically accurate [2].\n",
