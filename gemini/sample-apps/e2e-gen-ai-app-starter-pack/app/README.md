# Sample Chatbot Application

This folder implements a chatbot application using FastAPI, and Google Cloud services. It supports multiple conversation patterns and can be easily extended with new chains.

## Generative AI Application Patterns

### 1. Default Chain

The default chain is a simple conversational bot that produces recipes based on user questions.

### 2. Custom RAG QA

A RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chain using Python for orchestration and base LangChain components. The chain demonstrates how to create a production-grade application with full control over the orchestration process.

This approach offers maximum flexibility in the orchestration of steps and allows for seamless integration with other SDK frameworks such as [Vertex AI SDK](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/python-sdk/use-vertex-ai-python-sdk) and [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/), retaining the support to emit `astream_events` [API compatible events](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/streaming/#using-stream-events).

### 3. LangGraph Dummy Agent

A simple agent implemented using LangGraph, a framework for building agent and multi-agent workflows.

### 4. RAG with Vertex AI Agent Builder Search

A RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pattern using Vertex AI Agent Builder Search for the retrieval of information. It includes a data ingestion pipeline to automate the update of your data. For more details on how to set it up please review the related readme file under the respective folder.

### Switching Between Patterns

To switch between different patterns, modify the import statement in `server.py`.

All chains have the same interface, allowing for seamless swapping without changes to the Streamlit frontend.

## Monitoring and Observability

### Trace and Log Capture

This application utilizes [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) and [OpenLLMetry](https://github.com/traceloop/openllmetry) for comprehensive observability, emitting events to Google Cloud Trace and Google Cloud Logging. Every interaction with LangChain and VertexAI is instrumented (see [`server.py`](server.py)), enabling detailed tracing of request flows throughout the application.

Leveraging the [CloudTraceSpanExporter](https://cloud.google.com/python/docs/reference/spanner/latest/opentelemetry-tracing), the application captures and exports tracing data. To address the limitations of Cloud Trace ([256-byte attribute value limit](https://cloud.google.com/trace/docs/quotas#limits_on_spans)) and [Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging/quotas) ([256KB log entry size](https://cloud.google.com/logging/quotas)), a custom extension of the CloudTraceSpanExporter is implemented in [`app/utils/tracing.py`](app/utils/tracing.py).

This extension enhances observability by:

- Creating a corresponding Google Cloud Logging entry for every captured event.
- Automatically storing event data in Google Cloud Storage when the payload exceeds 256KB.

Logged payloads are associated with the original trace, ensuring seamless access from the Cloud Trace console.

### Log Router

Events are forwarded to BigQuery through a [log router](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/routing/overview) for long-term storage and analysis. The deployment of the log router is done via Terraform code in [deployment/terraform](../deployment/terraform).

### Looker Studio Dashboard

Once the data is written to BigQuery, it can be used to populate a [Looker Studio dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/c/reporting/fa742264-4b4b-4c56-81e6-a667dd0f853f/page/tEnnC).

This dashboard, offered as a template, provides a starting point for building custom visualizations on the top of the data being captured.
