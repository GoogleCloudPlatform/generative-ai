QuickBot App is a set of templates that can be deployed out of the box into Cloud Run and work independently. Each one can be run independently connected to the user default google cloud auth credentials, and based on the complexity of each template, may require to deploy more or less resources into our Google Cloud Project. 
The architecture always follows the following structure: a folder for the frontend which consists in an Angular app, and a backend folder which consists of a FastAPI Python app.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.1.3.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Code Styling & Commit Guidelines

To maintain code quality and consistency:

* **TypeScript (Frontend):** We follow [Angular Coding Style Guide](https://angular.dev/style-guide) by leveraging the use of [Google's TypeScript Style Guide](https://github.com/google/gts) using `gts`. This includes a formatter, linter, and automatic code fixer.
* **Python (Backend):** We adhere to the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html), using tools like `pylint` and `black` for linting and formatting.
* **Commit Messages:** We suggest following [Angular's Commit Message Guidelines](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/main/contributing-docs/commit-message-guidelines.md) to create clear and descriptive commit messages.

#### Frontend (TypeScript with `gts`)

1.  **Initialize `gts` (if not already done in the project):**
    Navigate to the `frontend/` directory and run:
    ```bash
    npx gts init
    ```
    This will set up `gts` and create necessary configuration files (like `tsconfig.json`). Ensure your `tsconfig.json` (or a related gts config file like `.gtsrc`) includes an extension for `gts` defaults, typically:
    ```json
    {
      "extends": "./node_modules/gts/tsconfig-google.json",
      // ... other configurations
    }
    ```
2.  **Check for linting issues:**
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```
    (This assumes a `lint` script is defined in `package.json`, e.g., `"lint": "gts lint"`)
3.  **Fix linting issues automatically (where possible):**
    ```bash
    npm run fix
    ```
    (This assumes a `fix` script is defined in `package.json`, e.g., `"fix": "gts fix"`)

#### Backend (Python with `pylint` and `black`)

1.  **Ensure Dependencies are Installed:**
    Add `pylint` and `black` to your `backend/requirements.txt` file:
    ```
    pylint
    black
    ```
    Then install them within your virtual environment:
    ```bash
    pip install pylint black
    # or pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Configure `pylint`:**
    It's recommended to have a `.pylintrc` file in your `backend/` directory to configure `pylint` rules. You might need to copy a standard one or generate one (`pylint --generate-rcfile > .pylintrc`).
3.  **Check for linting issues with `pylint`:**
    Navigate to the `backend/` directory and run:
    ```bash
    pylint .
    ```
    (Or specify modules/packages: `pylint your_module_name`)
4.  **Format code with `black`:**
    To automatically format all Python files in the current directory and subdirectories:
    ```bash
    python -m black . --line-length=80
    ```
