# This script allows you to authenticate BOTH through ADC and with normal gcloud login.
# These script require you to use both ADC (for text2speech) and gcloud login (for Gemini).
# If you find how to do with a single login, please write me or file a PR!
# This script also supports Service Account key. Just create a SA, give it the right powers,
# and then download the key. finally rename the key to "private/PROJECT_ID.json" to match
# the STD_SA_LOCATION var in this script.
