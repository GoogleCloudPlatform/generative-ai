        "- **Noise Reduction:** Outliers, inconsistencies, or irrelevant examples hurt model adaptation. Implement preprocessing, such as removing duplicates, fixing typos, and verifying that data conforms to your task's expectations.\n",
        "- **Distribution:** A diverse range of examples will help your model generalize better within the confines of your target task. Refrain from overloading the process with excessive variance that strays from your core domain.\n",

These instructions can be expressed in various forms, such as step-by-step procedures, commands, or rules. When we don't use the instructions, it's only a question and answer. The instruction tells the large language model what to do. We want them to answer the question. We have to give a hint about the task we want to perform. Let's extend the dataset with an instruction."
