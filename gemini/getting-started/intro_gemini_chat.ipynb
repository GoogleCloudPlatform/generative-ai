It is estimated that in about 100 million years, Phobos will either crash into Mars or break up into a ring.\\n\\n**Deimos**\\n\\n* **Outer moon of Mars:** Deimos orbits about 23,500 kilometers (14,600 miles) from the planet\\'s surface.\\n* **Small and irregularly shaped:** Deimos is even smaller and more irregularly shaped than Phobos.\\n* **Slow orbit:** Deimos takes about 30 hours to complete one orbit around Mars.\\n* **Captured asteroid:** Deimos is believed to be a captured asteroid rather than a moon that formed alongside Mars.\\n* **Speculation of being artificial:** In 1958, Soviet astronomer Iosif Shklovsky suggested that Deimos might be an artificial satellite placed in orbit around Mars by an advanced extraterrestrial civilization.
