They were the sons of the Greek god Ares, who is the Roman equivalent of Mars.\\n- Phobos is the only moon in the solar system known to have a retrograde orbit, meaning that it orbits Mars in the opposite direction of the planet\\'s rotation.\\n- Deimos is the outermost moon in the solar system.\\n- Both Phobos and Deimos are thought to be relatively young, with ages of only a few hundred million years.\\n- The moons of Mars are not visible from Earth with the naked eye, even with a telescope.\"\n",
