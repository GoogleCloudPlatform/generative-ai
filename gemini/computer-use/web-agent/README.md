# Gemini Computer Use Web Agent Demo

Authors: [Eric Dong](https://github.com/gericdong)

This repository contains a Python script (`web_agent.py`) that demonstrates a web automation agent powered by the Gemini Computer Use model. The agent uses Playwright to control a browser and can perform multi-step tasks based on a natural language prompt.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

* Python 3.9+
* `pip` (Python package installer)
* [Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud` CLI)](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install-sdk)

## Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the agent in your local environment.

**1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai.git
cd generative-ai/gemini/computer-use/web-agent
```

**2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage project dependencies.

* On macOS and Linux:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

* On Windows:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

**3. Install Python Dependencies**

Install the required Python libraries from the requirements.txt file.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Install Playwright Browsers**

This command downloads the browser binaries (like Chromium) that Playwright needs to control the browser.

```bash
playwright install
```

**5. Authenticate with Google Cloud**

Log in with your Google Cloud account to allow the script to access the Gemini API.

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
```

**6. Configuration**
This script requires a Google Cloud Project ID to be set as an environment variable.

* **On macOS and Linux:**
    ```bash
    export GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID="[your-project-id]"
    ```
* **On Windows (Command Prompt):**
    ```bash
    set GOOGLE_PROJECT_ID="[your-project-id]"
    ```

Replace `[your-project-id]` with your actual Google Cloud Project ID. You only need to set this once per terminal session.

**7. Running the Agent**
Once the setup is complete, you can run the agent with the following command:

```bash
python web_agent.py
```

By default, the script will run with a pre-defined prompt. You can change the task by editing the prompt variable at the bottom of the `web_agent.py` file.
