        "Gemini 1.5 Flash comes standard with a 1 million token context window, and Gemini 1.5 Pro comes with a 2 million token context window. Historically, large language models (LLMs) were significantly limited by the amount of text (or tokens) that could be passed to the model at one time. The Gemini 1.5 long context window, with [near-perfect retrieval (>99%)](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/gemini/gemini_v1_5_report.pdf), unlocks many new use cases and developer paradigms.\n",
        "\n",
        "In practice, 1 million tokens would look like:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   50,000 lines of code (with the standard 80 characters per line)\n",
        "-   All the text messages you have sent in the last 5 years\n",

        "context window is short term memory. There is a limited amount of information\n",
        "that can be stored in someone's short term memory, and the same is true for\n",
        "generative models.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can read more about how models work under the hood in our [generative models guide](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/learn/overview).\n",
        "\n",
        "Even though the models can take in more and more context, much of the\n",
        "conventional wisdom about using large language models assumes this inherent\n",
        "limitation on the model, which as of 2024, is no longer the case.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some common strategies to handle the limitation of small context windows\n",
        "included:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   Arbitrarily dropping old messages / text from the context window as new text\n",
        "    comes in\n",
        "-   Summarizing previous content and replacing it with the summary when the\n",
        "    context window gets close to being full\n",
        "-   Using RAG with semantic search to move data out of the context window and\n",
        "    into a vector database\n",
        "-   Using deterministic or generative filters to remove certain text /\n",
        "    characters from prompts to save tokens\n",
        "\n",
        "While many of these are still relevant in certain cases, the default place to start is now just putting all of the tokens into the context window. Because Gemini 1.5 models were purpose-built with a long context window, they are much more capable of in-context learning. This means that instructional materials provided in context can be highly effective for handling inputs that are not covered by the model's training data."
