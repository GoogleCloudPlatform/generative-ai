    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "[Grounding in Vertex AI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/ground-gemini) lets you use generative text models to generate content grounded in your own documents and data. This capability lets the model access information at runtime that goes beyond its training data. By grounding model responses in Google Search results or data stores within [Vertex AI Search](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/enterprise-search-introduction), LLMs that are grounded in data can produce more accurate, up-to-date, and relevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grounding provides the following benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reduces model hallucinations (instances where the model generates content that isn't factual)\n",
    "- Anchors model responses to specific information, documents, and data sources\n",
    "- Enhances the trustworthiness, accuracy, and applicability of the generated content\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of grounding in Vertex AI, you can configure two different sources of grounding:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Google Search results for data that is publicly available and indexed\n",
    "2. [Data stores in Vertex AI Search](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/create-datastore-ingest), which can include your own data in the form of website data, unstructured data, or structured data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Allowlisting\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the features in this sample notebook require access to certain features via an allowlist. [Grounding with Vertex AI Search](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/ground-gemini) is available in Public Preview, whereas Grounding with Google Search results is generally available.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use this service in a production application, you will also need to [use a Google Search entry point](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/grounding-search-entry-points)."
