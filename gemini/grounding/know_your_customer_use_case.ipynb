The primary goal of KYC is to prevent financial crimes like money laundering, terrorist financing, and fraud.\n",

As part of this process you might choose to do a background check to evaluate whether or not the candidate has been involved in any illegal activities. Then based on the report recieved you can make a more informed decision whether to proceed with the candidate or not. This can be applied to many other use cases and across many entity types (companies, people, vessels, governments, etc.)"

              "Summary: Retired four-star U.S. Navy Admiral Robert Burke, 62, was found guilty of bribery and conspiracy charges following a five-day federal trial in Washington, D.C.. Burke was convicted of steering lucrative government contracts to a company called Next Jump in exchange for a high-paying post-retirement job with the firm, which he began in October 2022 with a yearly salary of $500,000 and 100,000 stock options.. The charges include conspiracy to commit bribery, bribery, performing acts affecting a personal financial interest, and concealing material facts from the United States. Prosecutors stated that Burke misused his position, which included overseeing U.S. naval operations in Europe, Russia, and most of Africa from 2020 to 2022, to benefit financially. He allegedly ordered his staff to award a $355,000 contract to Company A (Next Jump) to train personnel in Italy and Spain, and later attempted to convince another senior Navy official to award a larger contract to the same company. Burke was arrested in May 2024 on these charges, making him the most senior military officer to be convicted for crimes committed while on active duty in recent times. His sentencing is scheduled for August 22, 2025, and he faces a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison. The co-CEOs of Next Jump, Yongchul “Charlie” Kim and Meghan Messenger, are also facing related charges and are scheduled for trial in August.\n",
