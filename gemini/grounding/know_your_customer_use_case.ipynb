A federal jury found Burke guilty of conspiracy to commit bribery, bribery, performing acts affecting a personal financial interest, and concealing material facts from the United States. He was accused of steering a lucrative government contract to a company in exchange for a high-paying job with that same company after his retirement.\n",
              "Burke ordered his staff to award a $355,000 contract to \"Company A\" (later identified as Next Jump) to train personnel under his command in Italy and Spain in December 2021. Prosecutors alleged that Burke, along with co-CEOs of the company, Yongchul \"Charlie\" Kim and Meghan Messenger, agreed that Burke would use his position to steer a contract in exchange for future employment. He began working at the company in October 2022 with a yearly starting salary of $500,000. This verdict makes Burke the most senior officer to be convicted in recent times for crimes committed while serving in the U.S. military. Sentencing for Burke is scheduled for August 22, 2025."

        "Summary: Robert Burke, a retired Navy Admiral, and two business executives, Yongchul \"Charlie\" Kim and Meghan Messenger, were arrested on charges related to an alleged bribery scheme. The indictment states that Burke accepted future employment at the executives' company in exchange for awarding them a U.S. government contract. The scheme involved Burke ordering his staff in December 2021 to award a $355,000 contract to Company A to train personnel under his command, and he began working at Company A in October 2022 with a $500,000 yearly salary and 100,000 stock options.\n",
