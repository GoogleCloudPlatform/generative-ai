        "Text extraction is a process of extracting text from a document. This can be done manually or automatically. Manual text extraction is the process of reading the document and copying the text into a new document. Automatic text extraction is the process of using software to extract the text from the document.\n",
        "\n",
        "Text extraction can be used for a variety of purposes. One common purpose is to convert documents into a machine-readable format. This can be useful for storing documents in a database or for processing documents with software. Another common purpose is to extract information from documents. This can be useful for finding specific information in a document or for summarizing the content of a document.\n",
        "\n",
        "Large language models (LLMs) are good for text extraction because they are trained on massive datasets of text and code, which allows them to learn the relationships between words and phrases. They can also understand the context of text and generate text, which allows them to extract information that is not explicitly stated or fill in the gaps in text that is missing information. The answers from LLMs can also be further improved through methods like few-shot prompting.\n",
