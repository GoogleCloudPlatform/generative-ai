    "When developing Generative AI (Gen AI) applications, prompt engineering poses challenges due to its time-consuming and error-prone nature. Significant effort is involved when crafting and inputting prompts to achieve successful task completion. With the frequent release of foundational models, you face the added burden of migrating working prompts from one model version to another.\n",

    "Vertex AI prompt optimizer alleviates these challenges by providing an intelligent prompt optimization tool. With this tool you can both translate and optimize system instructions in the prompts and best demonstrations (examples) for prompt templates, which lets you shape LLM responses from any source model to a target Google model.\n",

    "    3 - Moderate: The response demonstrates clear personalization and attempts to engage the user with relevant follow-up questions or prompts based on their query. The tone is friendly and supportive, fostering a positive user experience.\n",
    "    4 - High: The response demonstrates a high degree of personalization and actively engages the user with relevant follow-up questions or prompts. The tone is empathetic and understanding, creating a strong connection with the user.\n",
    "    5 - Exceptional: The response goes above and beyond to personalize the experience, anticipating user needs, and fostering a genuine connection. The tone is warm, encouraging, and inspiring, leaving the user feeling empowered and motivated.\n",

    "    ## Evaluation steps\n",
    "    Step 1: Carefully read both the question and the generated response. Ensure a clear understanding of the user's intent, needs, and any specific context provided.\n",
    "    Step 2: Evaluate how well the response directly addresses the user's query and demonstrates an understanding of their specific needs or preferences.\n",

    "    Step 4: Evaluate Tone & Empathy: Analyze the tone of the response, ensuring it fosters a positive and supportive user experience, making the user feel heard and understood.\n",
    "    Step 5: Based on the three criteria above, assign a score from 1 to 5 according to the score rubric.\n",

    "      **Prioritize Low and Slow:**\n",
    "      * **Braising and Stewing:** These techniques involve gently simmering meat in liquid over low heat for an extended period. This breaks down tough collagen, resulting in incredibly tender and flavorful meat. Plus, since the cooking temperature is lower, it minimizes the formation of potentially harmful compounds associated with high-heat cooking.\n",
    "      * **Sous Vide:** This method involves sealing meat in a vacuum bag and immersing it in a precisely temperature-controlled water bath.  It allows for even cooking to the exact desired doneness, resulting in incredibly juicy and tender meat.  Because the temperature is controlled and lower than traditional methods, it can be a healthier option.\n",
    "      **High Heat Tips:**\n",
    "      * **Marinades are Your Friend:** As you mentioned, acidic marinades tenderize meat.  They also add flavor!\n",
    "      * **Temperature Control is Key:**  Use a meat thermometer to ensure you reach the safe internal temperature of 145°F (63°C) without overcooking.\n",
    "      * **Don't Burn It!**  While some browning is desirable, charring creates those unhealthy compounds.  Pat meat dry before cooking to minimize steaming and promote browning.  Let the pan heat up properly before adding the meat to achieve a good sear.\n",
    "\n",
    "      **Remember:**  Trim visible fat before cooking to reduce saturated fat content.  Let meat rest after cooking; this allows juices to redistribute, resulting in a more tender and flavorful final product.\n",

    "Vertex AI prompt optimizer lets you control the optimization process by specifying what to optimize (instructions only, demonstrations only, or both), providing a system instruction and prompt template, and selecting the target model.  You can optionally refine the optimization with some advanced settings like its duration and the number of optimization iterations it runs, which models the Vertex AI prompt optimizer uses, and other parameters to control the structure and content of prompts. Below you have some common and recommended default configurations.\n",

    "* `custom_metric_name` parameter which lets you pass your own custom metric to optimizer the prompt template.\n",

    "* `custom_metric_cloud_function_name` parameter which indicates the Cloud function to call for collecting custom function evaluation metric output.\n",

It's perfect for delicate fish like sole or cod.\n* **Steaming:**  Cooking fish on a rack above simmering liquid allows the steam to gently cook the flesh, retaining moisture and nutrients. This method is ideal for flaky fish like salmon or trout.\n* **En Papillote:** Baking fish in parchment paper or foil traps moisture and infuses flavors from added herbs, vegetables, and sauces. This technique works well with firm fish like halibut or snapper.\n\n**Quick Cooking Methods:**\n\n* **Pan-Searing:** A hot pan and a touch of oil create a flavorful crust while keeping the inside moist. This method is versatile and works well with various fish types.  Be sure to sear for a shorter time on the second side.\n* **Broiling:**  Cooking fish a short distance from a heat source creates a crispy exterior and moist interior. This method is excellent for thicker cuts of fish like tuna or swordfish.\n\n**Key Points to Remember:**\n\n* **Don't overcook!** Fish is done when it turns opaque and flakes easily with a fork.\n* **Use a thermometer:**  For accuracy, aim for an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C).\n* **Add moisture:** Cooking with a sauce, herbs, citrus slices, or a drizzle of oil helps prevent dryness. \n\nBy using these techniques and paying attention to cooking times, you can create delicious and healthy fish dishes that are bursting with flavor and nutrients. \n</div></td>\n      <td id=\"T_9d795_row7_col9\" class=\"data row7 col9\" ><div class=\"scrollable\">QUESTION: What are some techniques to cook fish perfectly while still retaining its moisture and nutrients? \n\nnContext:\nFish cooks very quickly, so it's important to keep an eye on it to prevent overcooking. \nOvercooked fish will be dry and tough, and will have lost some of its nutritional value.\nTo help retain moisture, consider cooking your fish with a sauce or some aromatics like herbs and citrus. \n</div></td>\n      <td id=\"T_9d795_row7_col10\" class=\"data row7 col10\" ><div class=\"scrollable\">You are a brilliant culinary assistant, adept at extracting key information and offering insightful cooking advice.

This process plumps up the chicken with moisture, ensuring it stays juicy, and infuses it with delicious flavors.\n\n* **Poaching/Steaming:** These methods gently cook chicken in liquid (poaching) or with steam, preserving moisture and creating a tender texture.  You can infuse the poaching liquid or the water used for steaming with herbs, spices, and aromatics for added flavor.\n\n* **Roasting with Aromatics:** While roasting does use some fat, you can minimize it.  Instead of basting with oil, roast the chicken with aromatics like lemon slices, garlic cloves, and herbs tucked inside the cavity.

These techniques will help you cook fish perfectly while retaining its nutrients and moisture.\"}\n</div></td>\n      <td id=\"T_9d795_row29_col12\" class=\"data row29 col12\" ><div class=\"scrollable\">Here are a few techniques to cook fish perfectly and retain moisture and nutrients:\n\n* **Baking en Papillote:**  This fancy French term simply means \"in parchment.\"  Creating a parchment (or foil) packet traps moisture, essentially steaming the fish. This method is fantastic for preserving nutrients and yielding moist, flavorful fillets. \n\n* **Pan-Searing:**  Start with a hot pan and a touch of oil. Sear the fish for a couple of minutes per side to develop a crispy crust, then lower the heat and finish cooking until just opaque in the center.  The initial sear helps lock in moisture. \n\n* **Poaching:**  This gentle method involves submerging the fish in a flavorful liquid (water, broth, or wine) and cooking it over low heat.  Poaching is known for producing incredibly moist and tender fish while also infusing it with subtle flavors. \n\nRemember, the key is to avoid overcooking! Use a thermometer to check for doneness – aim for an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C). \n</div></td>\n      <td id=\"T_9d795_row29_col13\" class=\"data row29 col13\" ><div class=\"scrollable\">1.8</div></td>\n      <td id=\"T_9d795_row29_col14\" class=\"data row29 col14\" ><div class=\"scrollable\">Relevance and Customization: The response provides relevant information by reiterating the given context, but it lacks any customization or depth beyond the provided tips.

This ensures even cooking and develops a flavorful crust without overcooking the interior. Lower and slower cooking minimizes the formation of HCAs. Using acidic marinades tenderizes the meat and adds flavor. It is important to use a meat thermometer to ensure the meat reaches a safe internal temperature of 145°F (63°C) and to avoid overcooking.Step 2: The final answer identified in the response is: Marinating meat in acidic marinades like lemon juice or vinegar helps break down tough proteins, resulting in a more tender product. Grilling and pan-searing utilize high heat, promoting the Maillard reaction, which creates flavorful browning and crusts. Ensure the meat reaches an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C) for safety.Step 3: The response mentions marinating in acidic solutions like lemon juice or vinegar for tenderizing, which is mentioned in the reference. The response also mentions high-heat cooking methods like grilling and pan-searing for flavorful browning and crusts through the Maillard reaction, which, although not directly mentioned in reference, can be inferred. Lastly, the response correctly states the safe internal temperature of 145°F (63°C). It fails to mention lower and slower cooking methods which is a central idea in the reference.Step 4: Score: 0</div></td>\n      <td id=\"T_9d795_row42_col6\" class=\"data row42 col6\" ><div class=\"scrollable\">0</div></td>\n      <td id=\"T_9d795_row42_col7\" class=\"data row42 col7\" ><div class=\"scrollable\">What are some techniques for cooking red meat and pork that maximize flavor and tenderness while minimizing the formation of harmful compounds? \n\nnContext:\nRed meat and pork should be cooked to an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C) for safety. \nMarinating meat in acidic ingredients like lemon juice or vinegar can help break down tough proteins, resulting in a more tender final product. \nHigh-heat cooking methods like grilling and pan-searing can produce flavorful browning and crusts due to the Maillard reaction. \n</div></td>\n      <td id=\"T_9d795_row42_col8\" class=\"data row42 col8\" ><div class=\"scrollable\">Here's how we can cook flavorful and tender red meat and pork while keeping things healthy:\n\n**Focus on lower, slower cooking:**\n\n* **Braising and Stewing:** These techniques are excellent for tougher cuts of meat.

Think Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, silken tofu, or even a dollop of nut butter. These options contribute protein along with other valuable nutrients and often create a creamier texture. \n\n* **Embrace Natural Sweetness:**  As you mentioned, frozen fruits are fantastic!  Dates are another excellent option. They add a caramel-like sweetness and blend beautifully. A little goes a long way, so start with one or two and adjust to your liking. \n\n* **Spice It Up:** Don't be afraid to experiment with spices!

Cucumber is another great addition for a refreshing twist. You can even sneak in some cauliflower – it blends up surprisingly smooth and adds a boost of fiber.\n\nRemember, the key is to find what you enjoy!

Think Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, silken tofu, or even a dollop of nut butter. These options contribute protein along with other valuable nutrients and often create a creamier texture.\n\n* Embrace Natural Sweetness: As you mentioned, frozen fruits are fantastic! Dates are another excellent option. They add a caramel-like sweetness and blend beautifully. A little goes a long way, so start with one or two and adjust to your liking.\n\n* Spice It Up: Don't be afraid to experiment with spices! Cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and even a pinch of cardamom can add warmth, depth, and complexity to your shakes.\n\n* Get Creative with Veggies: You're spot on about spinach and kale. Cucumber is another great addition for a refreshing twist. You can even sneak in some cauliflower – it blends up surprisingly smooth and adds a boost of fiber.\n\nRemember, the key is to find what you enjoy! Experiment with different flavor combinations and techniques to create protein shakes that are both good for you and delicious.\nStep 2: The final answer identified in the response is: To make a protein shake that's both delicious and nutritious, consider adding a handful of spinach or kale for a boost of nutrients without sacrificing flavor. Frozen fruits like berries or bananas add natural sweetness and a thicker, smoother texture. For a healthier base, opt for unsweetened almond milk, coconut water, or even plain water instead of sugary fruit juices or sports drinks.\nStep 3: The response mentions spinach/kale and frozen fruit for sweetness and texture, which are mentioned in the reference. It also discusses using unsweetened almond milk, coconut water, or plain water, which aligns with the reference's emphasis on avoiding sugary drinks. The response does not contradict the reference. However, the reference contains additional information about whole food protein sources, dates as sweeteners, spices, and other vegetables. Thus, the response does not contain all claims from the reference and has omitted some key details, making it an incorrect answer.\nStep 4: Score: 0</div></td>\n      <td id=\"T_9d795_row48_col6\" class=\"data row48 col6\" ><div class=\"scrollable\">0</div></td>\n      <td id=\"T_9d795_row48_col7\" class=\"data row48 col7\" ><div class=\"scrollable\">What are some techniques for making protein shakes that are both delicious and nutritious, without using excessive sugar or artificial ingredients? \n\nnContext:\nAdding a handful of spinach or kale is a great way to boost the nutrient content of your shake without significantly impacting the flavor. \n\nUsing frozen fruits, like berries or bananas, not only adds natural sweetness and flavor but also creates a thicker, smoother texture. \n\nOpt for unsweetened almond milk, coconut water, or even plain water as your base liquid instead of sugary fruit juices or sports drinks. \n</div></td>\n      <td id=\"T_9d795_row48_col8\" class=\"data row48 col8\" ><div class=\"scrollable\">That's a great question!
