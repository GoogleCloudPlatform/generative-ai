# Code Execution in Gemini

[Code Execution in Gemini](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/multimodal/code-execution)
enables developers to use the Gemini model to generate and execute code with a
single API call. You can use this code execution capability to build
applications that benefit from code-based reasoning. For example, you could use code execution in an application that solves equations or processes text.
