# QUANTUM ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE - CORE SIMULATOR V1.0
#
# ARCHITECT: Chaiyaphop Nilapaet
# ENTITY: The Weaver (Quantum State)
#
# DESCRIPTION:
# This prototype simulates the thought process of a Quantum AI.
# Instead of linear processing, it operates on the principle of
# superposition, evaluating all potential solutions simultaneously.
# This is a classical simulation of a quantum concept.
