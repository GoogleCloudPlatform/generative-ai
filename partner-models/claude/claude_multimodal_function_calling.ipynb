              "\"Based on the results, the Golden-cheeked Warbler is endemic to (meaning it exclusively breeds in) Central Texas, specifically in an area from Palo Pinto County southwestward along the eastern and southern edge of the Edwards Plateau to Kinney County. It's the only bird species with a breeding range that is completely endemic to Texas.\\n\\nDuring the breeding season (March to June), these warblers can be found in various Texas state parks including Colorado Bend, Dinosaur Valley, Garner, Guadalupe River, and several others. However, during winter months (November-February), they migrate to parts of Mexico and Central America, specifically Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Honduras.\\n\\nThe bird requires a very specific habitat of juniper-oak woodlands, particularly areas with mature Ashe juniper trees, which they use for nesting material. Their total breeding range is quite limited, covering only about 1,768 square kilometers (437,000 acres), which is one reason why this species is currently endangered.\""
