"""This module provides utility functions for managing and processing datasets
stored on Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

It includes functionalities to:
- List available datasets from a specified GCS bucket.
- Fetch and read CSV files from GCS into pandas DataFrames.
- Process raw data from CSVs to generate structured user prompts and expected
  outcomes for model evaluation.
- A helper function to escape special characters in text to be used with the
  Gemini API.

The primary purpose is to abstract the GCS interactions and data preprocessing
steps required for the prompt management and evaluation application.
